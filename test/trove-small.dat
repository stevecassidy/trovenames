A gentlewoman in London, after having buried six husbands, found a gentleman hardy enough to make her a wife once more. For several months their happiness seemed to pay no great compliment to her former partners, who, as she said, had disgusted her by their sottishness. Knowing the real character of his mate, the gentleman began frequently to absent himself, to return at late hours, and when he did return, to appear as if intoxicated. At first reproaches, but after menaces, were the consequences of his conduct. The gentleman persisted, anti seemed every day to become more addicted to the bottle. One evening, when she imagined him dead drunk, she unsowed a leaden weight from the sleeve of her gown, and having melted it, she approached her husband, who pretended to be still sound asleep, in order to pour it Into his ear through a pipe. Convinced of her wickedness, he started tip and seized her; when, having procured nassitance, he secured her till morning, and conducted her before a, magistrate, who committed her to prison. The bodies of her six husbands were taken up, and as marks of violence were still visible upon them, the proof of her guilt appeared so strong upon her trial that she was condemned and executed on October 17, 1698. To this circumstance, It is said, England is indebted for that useful regulation by which no corpse can be interred in this kingdom without a legal inspection.","wordCount":268,"illustrated":false}

The flint pebble industry gives occupation to many women and children along the French coast lying between Havre and Dieppe.

Representative for Broadford and Kilm6re DistrictDUNCAN 0 McRAE Sconomy Thinking people are aware that the most rigid economy should be practised by all classes of the community during the crisis through which the world is passing. No sue is so far seeing or so wire as to be able to forecast events a day ahead, and it stands every man and woman in hand to exercise care in every item of household expenditure. By keeping nell-by keeping the system in good order by using Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills-a remedy used by thousands--one important item of expense is avoided. This simple but effective remedy will keep the system clean, the Liver and Kidneys in proper working order, and serious illnesses requiring expensive medical treatment thereby made unnecessary. It is therefore proper to remind the public that Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills are an economical remedy sold at a price within the reach of all classes. Although the cost of production has greatly increased there has been no advance made in the selling price of this remedy. There are on an average forty pills in each bottle, and generally they are old from one sooohilling to one and threepence, depending on the local trade conditions. These pills are a standard remedy, and should be in the homes of every family. More costly medical attention and drugs can be avoided if reasonable care is taken and Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills used to keep the system in proper working order.

This freedom from tlaxtions will ecten I until the re'lenitption of the loan in 1923.

Jane Wearne and Captain Esthar Latclher has beean appointed in charge of the local corps. In more ways than one Labour is passing through a critical peri.tl. Long ieccastoome I to riding the higlt horse, circumstances have lately brought it down t the level of a suppliant. The Carpenters' Society which receintly refused to allow outof-work members to accept £1 a day and free travellint offered by the Commonwealth G?rvernment for some work at Stmarl-t, is petitioning Sthe Government, in former pauperie for free passages to E'ngland for some 400 unemployed carpenters. It appears that the general public find the war loan a more profitable investment tlhan the buildintg of houses, with\" none of the worries and anxieties which so frequently attend the employment of :labour; consequently little or no work is oifering in the building trades. The ciarpelOte's have boeni re-ding that in England 'even women are engagel in the making of aeroplaeos, whicl? is essentially joiners' work.\" and they are willing to cross the eas. and help provided a paternil Govern rtent will pay their expenses. Whether the British Government would be disposed to welcome these Australian workers, who turn up their nose at L£1 a day offered for war work by their otn Government is a moot point. The mere fact thlt Eaglish women are helping their men-folk to win the war by doinig \"what is essentially joiners' work\" would be sufficient to turn thu Australian carpenters into rapid I strike agitators, and Britain thasl troublesome oharacters enough of her ovn without supplementin' them by the Australian variety.","wordCount":831,"illustrated":false}

The pine trees of Finland are the gold-mines of the country, and really its chief trade. Pines and silver birches flourish on all sides. Everything or anything can apparently be made of birch bark in Finland; shoes, baskets, large or small, salt bottles, flower vases, even an entire suit of clothing is hanging up in Helsingfors .Museum, manufactured trom the bark of the silver birch. The lakes of Finland, of which there are live or six thousand, cover about one-sixth of the country, but these lakes, rivers and waterways all take their share in the wood trade. In thit autumn the trees are felled and left for the first fall of snow, when t.\" are dragged two or three miles, one behind the other. By this means the trees are conveyed to the nearest waterway, where they are stamped with the owner's registered mark and rolled upon the ice of lake or river to await the natural transport of spring. On they voyage, those soldiers of the forest, for hundreds of miles to the coast, till, finally, arriving at such an enormous wood export station as Kotka, they meet their doom. On the completion of the floating season, the stock of logs at Kotka often amounts to a million. On arrival at their destinatiou they are separated and distributed according to the marks of their respective owners. Large floating houses await their arri. val. The steam saw-mills are waiting for them, the trees as they go in have have-a-dozen saws run into them at once, and out come boards and planks of various thicknesses and widths, the best of which are sent to England.","wordCount":283,"illustrated":false}

The system of distributing wire netting among municipalities for the use of land owners desiring to net their holdings has been practically discontinued by the State Government ouing to the dilficulty in obtaining materials required for its manufacture. Supplies to the value of £500 were required by the Government and te!:ders were invited accordingly. This week the State Cabinet haind before it the question whether they should give preference to the extent of more than 10 per cent. to the Australian over the British manufacture offering, and it was dtecided to give preference to the Australian tender, which means that the prospect of cheaper netting is not likely to be realised for some time to come,. Two State schools in this shire have been closed lby the Edtucation DepartmIent-Clonbinano and Suitnday Creak, The former has been closed for the past few months chiefly owing to the decreased attendance of chillren. ,i, the latter case we undlerstald an effirt is to be made to have the school reopened, as quite ia anmhbtr of children are able to attend, Quite a nualbar of ratepayers in this shire are at a: loss to underetand why tlhe council still debate the question of aonalgamatiton tmeeting after meeting. Ever so many have remarked that when the council adopted the valuation, and raised the amount required under the n:ew Act, that would have been the end of it. A ratepayer in the East riding makes a must sensible remark in regard to matters past tand present. All rates cillected in past years have gone on to the main Strath road, consequently the by-roads have been neglected because a low valuation with a is rate has not provided sallicient money to attend to the by-roads, now undter new conditions they cats reasonably look forward to gettingl work done which in many places are badly needed, and what appllies to the East will naturally apply to the West. At the annual sports meeting of the Wundong Athletic Club on New Years' day it was announced that half of the proceeds would be donated to the Kilmoroe hospital. The Commi.sisc.ner of Taxes wrote to the secretary deannnding payment of the full amount of the tax, as thle whole of the proceeds were not being devoted to charity.

He Only Sleeps Five Hours a Day.","fulltext":"EDISON AT SEVENTY. He Only Sleeps Five Hours a Day. Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of modern times, is no friend of the time-waster or slumberer. It is interesting to note that his most famous inventions are those which proIduce sound, light and action-all wide.awake inventions; but he has never attempted to lighten the burden of the sleeper or slacker. Oliver Simmons, in a remarkable article in \"'dunsey's Magazine,\" says that sleep and food, light and dust:, the things that punctuate other men's lives, are negligible in the great in-I ventor's life. \\\\'When he is at workand that is most of the time--Edison has never allowed his mental capacity to be dulled by a meal or a bed. The sun tells other people, twice a day, that it is time t) rise or time to go to bed. It tells Edison nothing. It would not concern him-except as a scientific puzzle-if thle sun ceased its apparent rising and setting. Although he is nearly seventy years of age, he looks ten years younger, and has put in more practical work 'during his life time than any other man would do, even if he lived to be 150 years old. Edison generally sleeps five hours a 'day-that is if he is not particularly busy-going to bed at two In the morning and rising at seven. lie is somewhat sceptical about the motto, \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" \"Humanity adjusts itself to almost aniy circumstance,\" says Mr. Edison. \"But,\" he adds, \"if he wishes to halve his sleeping hours he must observe certain rules.\" IHere are the health rules \\lr. Edison follows:Alcoholic Alcoholic stimulant's must be avoid'ed; or, as Mr. Edison himself would say, \"No booze!\" If you use coffee to keep your lids open, dilute it freely, as Edison doe:, with hot milk. Don't take any more food than you neea to keep going. Your system has plenty of work without being asked to dispose of superfluous fuel. See that you have plenty of fresh air, and that your lighting system is adapted to the requirements of your eyes. When you go to bed, don't take your troubles with you. Edison doesn't, and lie is asleep in hall a minute. But the thing that you must have to start with is a job which interests you more than anything else in tile wJrld; a job which is lull of variety and action; a job which is your lite and your play, your present and your future. The latter, in the inventor's mind, is most important, and unless you have the work you are exceptionally interested in you will have to go back to the eight hours' snooze. But Edison, who is nothing if not energetic, naturally likes to have around him men of his own tastes and stamp, so lie has formed a squad called the Insomnia Squad. It is comprised of a group of hias most trusted assistants, who spend sleepless nights and days when they are searching for some missing link to complete a nbwh discovery. Edison makes the plans. lie lays out perhaps four or five hundred things to be done. The Insomnia Squad proceeds to do them. If there is a quarter of an hour when the chief can do nothing personally, lie stretches himself on the nearest bench, shelf or table, and in thirty seconds he is asleep. For years his pillow Was his own coat thrown over a chuck from a lathe. One of the family gave him a regular pillow, and he uses this now, because it saves the time that it would take to fold his coat. The following story shows that the Wizard is never discouraged by failure. After forty-eight hours of sleqpless, fruitless toil, a friend remarked that it was too bad that all his pains had produced' no results. \"No results,\" said Edison. \"Why, man, I get a lot of results. I know several thousand things that won't work.\"","wordCount":681,"illustrated":false}

A gentlewoman in London, after having buried six husbands, found a gentleman hardy enough to make her a wife once more. For several months their happiness seemed to pay no great compliment to her former partners, who, as she said, had disgusted her by their sottishness. Knowing the real character of his mate, the gentleman began frequently to absent himself, to return at late hours, and when he did return, to appear as if intoxicated. At first reproaches, but after menaces, were the consequences of his conduct. The gentleman persisted, anti seemed every day to become more addicted to the bottle. One evening, when she imagined him dead drunk, she unsowed a leaden weight from the sleeve of her gown, and having melted it, she approached her husband, who pretended to be still sound asleep, in order to pour it Into his ear through a pipe. Convinced of her wickedness, he started tip and seized her; when, having procured nassitance, he secured her till morning, and conducted her before a, magistrate, who committed her to prison. The bodies of her six husbands were taken up, and as marks of violence were still visible upon them, the proof of her guilt appeared so strong upon her trial that she was condemned and executed on October 17, 1698. To this circumstance, It is said, England is indebted for that useful regulation by which no corpse can be interred in this kingdom without a legal inspection.","wordCount":268,"illustrated":false}

She was alone with him in the parlor, Mr. and Mrs. Sturm having taken themselves stiffly from the room whilst the old lawyer broke the c great news to Rosa-the news of her unexpected heritage. The girl had listened eagerly to all .Mr. Curtis had to tell her, but now she sat bolt erect in her chair, hardly able to credit the amazing statement that the prim little grey-haired solicitor had just been making. Her eyes looked larger and rounder than ever-her color came and went. \"I don't wonder that you feel somewhat surprised-a little overcome.\" Mr. Curtis adjusted his goldmounted spectacles carefully. \"But I hope you will remember that your gain is Miss Rachel Taylor's loss. .Mliss Rachel might have destroyed Mr. Jordan's confession, but she has renounced a fine heritage in your favor; she has behaved splendidly.\" ' I don't say she hasn't.\" Rosa nodded her head thoughtfully. \"But I suppose she felt she'd no legal right to the property, seeing that I am my father's daughter. However, I'd like to deal generously by the young lady-hand her over some of the iloney.\" \"1 am glad you feel like that.\" Mr. Curtis smiled approvingly. \"Now, let us fix up an appointment for tomorrow. Can you meet me at my office at eleven -'clock, and then we can go through some papers together, and I will write to Miss Rachel Taylor to-night and tell her that there is no longer any reason to doubt that you are Mr. Jordan's daughter.\" \"lou might let her know at the same time that I'm coming down to the Red House on Saturday to get a bit acquainted with my future home -but you can explain as well that I shall not be in any hurry to turn Rachel out. She's welcome to stay on as long as she likes.\" Mr. Curtis started. Rosa's manner jarred on him horribly. He hated to think of her reigning at the Red House in Rachel's st d; still, there was nothing he could do to prevent it Rosa had the right to move into the Red .House at once-it was her own property. \"I think I will take my departure.\" The old solicitor bowed somewhat formally then presented his card to Rosa. \"Here is the address of my otffice. I shall expect you at eleven o'clock to-morrow.\" \"All right.\" Rosa gave a little giggle. \"I'll be there. I don't fancy they'll see me at the beauty shop to- I morrow. I shall be having other fish to fry. My goodness! How strange it all seems, though; but I rather fancy I'm in for a good time at last -a ripping time.\" She shook hands warmly with Mir. Curtis, but as soon as the lawyer had bowed himself out of the room, Rosa began to prance about the parlor. She could not help dancing for joy She was feeling more elated every moment-more excited; but.her wild dance came to an abrupt end when old Gwen hurried in, a queer look in her eyes. \"Has toe gentleman gone, dearie?\" she exclaimed; \"an' is it true-reany true-that you've come into a heap of money an' a fine place in the country?\"  \"Yes, it's quite true, Gwen,\" Rosa answered gleefully. \"I shall be a rich lady; but tell me-what does Cousin Kate say-and Cousin Silas? Do they grudge me my good fortune?\" gThey're They're none too pleased,\" Gwen muttered. \"Indeed, an' they sent me to tell you to take your immediate departure, dearie. This roof isn't to shelter you any longer.\" Rosa laughed rather, resentfully. \"What! Don't they want to congratulate me? Well, all right, Gwen,' I'm off. I'll write to you later on and tell you all my news, and I'll send you a little present.\" \"Dearie, there's something I want to tell you-something I-feel I ought to tell you.\" Gwen looked at Rosa in a scared, almost furtive way, but the young girl shook her head and walked to the door. \"I cannot stay any longer, Gwen, so your news must keep. 1 don't suppose you have anything really important to tell me, either-nothing that would signify much one way or another.' Rosa laughed and left the room. She was really anxious to leave the house where she was ruch an unwelcome guest, for she wanted to get\" back to her own little lodging and think things over quietly-meditate upon the change in her position-the wonderful, amaring change; also there were two letters that she must write-a letter to Dickie Melton and another letter to Debonair Harding, letter that it would take Rosa a long time to compose. She walked down the dark hall, swinging her arms jauntily, affecting an indifference she did not really feel, for at the bottom of her heart Rosa had no wish to meet the stern couple who had cast such a blight upon her youth; but she need not have been afraid. Mr. and Mrs. Sturm had sought refuge in their dining-room-the ugly room with the chairs upholstered in borsehaIr-the room that was full of the heavy smell of food, for the window was hardly ever opened-and the husband and wife were both waiting to hear the hall door close behind Rosa. But old Gwen fell on her knees when she heard the street-dour slam, and raised two trembling, toll-worn hands, and the struggle that was going on in her soul was plainly visible in her pale, quivering face. \"God forgive me!\" she murmured in low tones, \"for my share in this day's work. Oh, it isn't my dearie's fault that all this has happened! Rosa is quite innocent. She is only taking what she believex she has a right to take.\" Gwen pressed her'shaklng hands to her eyes. The whole room seemed to be going around, but a pale smile presently played about her lips and she gave an odd, croaking laugh. \"The money she'll have for her spending, an' the dance she'll lead the lads-for, indeed, they'll all buzz round her now like bees round a honey-pot. But dear Rosa won't make up her mind in a hurry. She'll pick and choose-marry some great lord, perhaps-there's no knowing,; an' she'll live in a fine big house, anyway, an' be waited on by crowds of servants. She'll ride in her own carriage-drive in her own car-wear satins an' velvets an' fur. Her body raiment will be as fine as the needlework the virgins of Israel worked for the king's daughter, whose clothing was of wrought gold.\" Gwen's eyes glistened. She rose 'slowly to her feet, and was about to leave the dingy, gloomy parlor, when the door 'opened somewhat jerkily and her mistress entered. Mrs. Sturm glanced sharply at Gwen, then she pulled at the brooch she wore at her throat. Her long, melancholy face had flushed; she kept pinching and pressing her thin lips. \"To think that Rosa should have turned up after all these years,\" she began, \"and just at the very moment when a solicitor was making inquiries about her. Anyone would think that the devil had had a hand in the business, for we know that Satan looks after his own, and it was too strange that Roza should call here to-day-the wicked, ungrateful little hussy; but I wouldn't shake hands with her, Gwen, neither would the master. She's a bad, bold girl, and she'll come to a bad end.- This mney will do her no good, mark my words; it may only be the means of her destruction.\" Mlrs. Sturm spoke in cold, measured tones, and she smiled sourly as she finished her speech, but old Gwen raised two trembling, indigisant hands.\"Indeed, \"Indeed, mistress, why should you speak so harshly of Miss Rosa? You have no right to call her a bad girl. She ran away from home, it is true; but then see how quiet you and the master kept her here. She was hardly ever allowed to stir out of doors. She was forbidden to go and see a play or to mix with companions of her own age-young folk. She wasn't allowed to dance or to go to parties. You tried to put an old head upon young shoulders.\" \"Be silent, Gwen! How dare you presume to criticise your employers like this?\" Mrs. Sturm spoke with sudden asperity. :'I cannot understand,\" she continued, frown!ug severely, \"why you have always taken that bad girl's part; but ever since Violet Jennings handed her infant daughter over to our charge-a brand whom we hoped to snatch from the burning-a child with bad blood in her veins if ever there was oneyou have been a fool over Rosa, a perfect-fool. Why, you used to neglect your work in the early days, I remember, to go and hang over the child's cradle, and you could never see a fault in Rosa as she grew up. But I realised from the first what a bad nature she had, and that we should have to try and whip the devil out of her, for there never was a more selfish girl-there never could be.\" \"indeed, an' you're wrong, mistress.\" Gwen interrupted. \"There's tans immense amount of good in Miss Rosa; and look how pretty she is!\" \"Her beauty has been her snare,\" Mrs. Sturm retorted, \"for even when she was quite a child Rosa got it into her head that everyone ought to give way to her and bow down to her wishes and caprices just because she was pretty. She forgot how we read in the Dible that \"Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain.'\" \"Yes, Miss Rosa may be vain, and I'm not saying she isn't, but she's got a kind heart-l'd swear to that -and a warm corner in it for me.' \"Well, as you're so fond of Rosaas you think more of her than anyone else, why don't you ask her to take you into her service Gwen, now that she is going to have a big house of her own? Not that I think she would do so for one minute. You wouldn't be smart enough for the situation, and I expect she has forgotten the care you took of her when she was a child. Why, I remember when she had only been with us a fortnight how Mr. Sturm and myself had to go away for a couple of months on account of the master's health, and we left Rosa in your clharge, and a poor, puny little baby she was, too; but when we came home you had taken sLch care of her that $he was quite plump and bloomIng; you would hardly have taken her for the same child.\" Gwen winced, then she looked down on the ground. \"No, mistress,\" she answered. \"I'll not be asking Miss Rosa to take me into her service as long as you and the master like to keep me with you. I have been a servant in this house over twenty-three years, and I wouldn't change my quarters for worlds-not but what \"d trust Miss Rosa through thick and thin-aye, I'd trust her with my very life.\" The old woman's face lit up as she said the last words-her eyes shone, but Mrs. Sturm's frown deepened, and she shook her head. 'I should be sorry to trust Rosa with anything. She is made up of selfishness and conceit. But go on believing in the girl if you want to, Gwen: only I am thankful for your sake that you have better friends to turn to than Rosa-the master and myself,' for we would never see you put to confusion.\" Gwen made no answer for a second beyond a low' sigh, then she dropped her mistress a queer little old-fashioned curtsey, and took her quiet way into the kitchen; but as soon as she reached her own domain Gwen put her apron over her head and burst into a sudden storm of tears. \"Oh, indeed, 'tis the wicked woman I am,\" she sobbed. \"I have done what I ought not to have done, and the burden of my sin presses heavily upon me. But spare the innocent, dear Lord; don't punish the innocent!\" CHAPTIR XXII. \"Thank heavens I shall soon be saying good-bye to this beastly room and to hard work. Oh, it will be jolly settling down at the Red House and having a ripping time. The clothes I'll buy-the dash I'll cut in the county-and won't I make the neighbors sit up! My! Won't the band h'um!\" Hosa pulled off her hat as she spoke, throwing it carelessly on the bed, and she laughed noisily. She had Just got back to her lodgings, and she was still in a state of considerable ndrvous excitement, wildly elated. Nor was this much to be wondered at consilderin3 the extraordln ary change in her fortunes. But she hardly gave a thought to the girl she was stripping of everything-she was absorbed in herself. \"I must write to that old cat, Madame Estelle, the first thing,\" Rosa decided, \"and tell her that she need not expect to see a flourishing heiress like myself trotting round to her beauty shop to-morrow-she can whistle for me; and as for Lady Bellerton-her ladyship can do up her own ugly face to -night; young Rosa won't betround to do it for her.\" Rosa began to cakewalk around the dingy bed-sitting-room which had been all her slender means could run to. Her spirits were getting higher every minute, and she was convinced that she would have no difficulty in marryine Captain Melton, thanks to the amazing change which had just taken place in her circumstances, and the thought of being a duchess one day appealed to Rosa strongly. She kicked and bounded as she danced; her eyes glittered, she was quite fey. \"Tate Gaiety chorus won't he in it this time,\" she reflected triumphantly. \"It's a girl from a beauty shop who has nabbed the future Duke of Ludlow-none of the actresses are going to have a look in.\" Rosa cakewalked up to the dressing-table and began to dust her flushed face vigorously with a powder puff, then her brows knit together itr a frown. She had suddenly remembered that there was something else she ought to do. \"Bless an' save us-I must write to Debonair as well as to Madame Estelle,\" .she reflected. \"There will be no need to pay a visit to the jeweller's with Debonair now-that littie game's off. She nodded her small -head. \"I ant thankful that matters got no further between us. Shouldn't I just have felt sick if I'd married the young man and then this had happened; for Harding's not my sort, really-far too pi.\" Rosa opened an untidy drawer and found some notepaper pushed at the1 back, also her fountain pen. The cover of a book served for a writingpad, and she settled herself down on her bed to write the letter which was to release Debonair from his engagement-a rather lengthy epistle, which took Rosa some time to compose; but it was written to her astisfaction at last. It was not a very literary composition, but it was a fairly truthful letter, for Rosa, after a certain amount of beating about the bush, explained that she had come to the conclusion that neither she nor Debonair were really suited to each other, and so they had better consider their brief engagement off. She did not take Debonair into her confidence with regard to the great fortune she had so unexpectedly inherited, but she told him in the letter tnat her circumstances had completely changed during the last few hours and that he need be under no apprehension with regard to her future. \"You'll hear news about me in your part of the world that will take your breath away as likely as not, later on,\" she wrote, \"but you mustn't think it mean of me breaking with you like this; for I know that you only asked me to marry you because you felt sorry for a poor, friendless girl, and I daresay you'll be awfully relieved when youget this letter. I wish you heaps of luck in the future, and I hope we shall always be the best of friends. Your little pal, Rosa.\" Rosa signed her name with a flourish, then she put her very illiterate letter into an envelope and gummed it down carefully, adds essing it to Debonair at the hotel where he was staying in London--nct a fashionable or expensive hotel by any means. \"Just fancy-we were to have met at lunch-titme to-morrow and gone to a jeweller's to buy my ring. Well, Debonair wi be spared that expense.\" She laughed heartlessly. \"The great softy! Couldn't he see I was only making up to him because he was - gentleman and I believed he'd have money when his people died? Did he think I was really in love-a girl like me?\" Her lips twisted into a disdainful smii-. \"A farm in Canada-hard work and a wedding ring-that was what Debonair's offer really came to. Oh, I couldn't have stuck it-no fear; besides, he wasn't the catch I once thought him.\" She nodded her head wisely. \"I'd rather have thrown in my lot with Dickie Melton than have gone out to Canada, if it comes to that-far.rather; but Dickie's got to marry me now, or I'll send him about his business, too. Marry me? I should rather think so.\" Rosa whisked off and took up her position in front of the looking-glass, peering at her own redection-mightily pleased with things in generalfull of plans for the future, and her eyes danced-as she thought of the shopping expedition that she would make next day, after she had got through her business at the lawyers; for she would ask Mr. Curtis to advance her some money, she decidedand, by Jove! wouldn't she spend it! \"I'll move into a decent hatel tomorrow-a real tip-top hotel, and I'd better engage a French maid, for I'm hanged if I'll even put on my own stockings in the future. I'll be waited on hand and foot-that I will.\" A smile of intense satisfaction played over Rosa'e small face. She had longed to be rich all her life. She had craved for the luxuries that she had never enjoyed. She had hoped against hope that some wealthy man might take it into his head to fall in love with her and suggest marriage. She had even gone so far as to wonder whether it really paid a girl to be virtuous, and now in a flash everything had changed. 'Rosa was no longer a hard-worked assistant in a beauty shop. She was a rich man's heiress-a rich man's only child. She would be able to buy all the things she had coveted-the luxuries that had been so far beyond her reach, and she grew half-dizzy with joy-her brain swam. ' 'll telephone to Dlckie first thing in the morning. I'll arrange to meet him at Prince's after I've had my talk with the old lawyer, and, my goodness, I shall have something to tell himn whilst we eat our lunch-and I will shop all the afternoon. I'll buy myself crowds of clothes-lovely lhats-petticoats, all lace and chiffon -gloves, scents, shoes, sunshades, and stdckings.\" Rosa's eyes glistened. She wished it was not so late in the evening. She would have liked to start on a shopping expedition at once. She was eager to clothe her body in the most delicate lingerie-lingerie fine and filmy. She wanted to draw silk stockings on her plump legs and squeeze her feet Into beautiful, highheeled French' shoes-to perfume her hair with highly-priced scentSquander money like water on her small person. A knock came at her door-a sharp tap,° and Rosa called out, \"Come in\"-and the next second her landlady entered, a tall, raw-boned voman with a thin, suspicious-lookIng face-a woman who had seen more of the ugly side of London life than she cared to admit, and who mistrusted everyone in consequence. \"There's a gentleman waiting outside in . motor. He's sent up this letter for you, Miss Jennings, and lie's waiting for an nswer. Pretty goings on, I call it!\" MIrs. Tupper looked at Rosa rather scornfully, the pretty lodger who had given her notice about an hour ago -the girl who was doubtless bent on following the road that leads to ruin-selfish, greedy, affected Rosa, who spent all her earnings on tier. own back and thought of no one but herself-considered no one. \"Give me my letter, please, and keep your amiable refilections to yourself.\" Rosa spoke with - certain amount of asperity, for she guessed what Mrs. Tupper was thinking. But as she opened Captain Melton's letter her color came and went, for what was Dickie writing about? He could not keep. away from her, apparently -she had him hard and fast. \"Dear Little Girl,-Come and dine with me again to-night and we'll try and lix up some sensible arrangement; but I must see you. Send a message down to say you'll come and I'll wait in the car while you put your hat on; but don't ke p me waiting an hour.-Dickie.\" Rosa's color kindled, then she looked straight at the tall, bony landlady. \"Tell the gentleman that I'll accept his invitation to dinner with pleasure, and that I'll be down in a few minutes.\" Mrs. Tupper hesitated. She did not care for Rosa, but the girl was very young and astonishingly pretty, and it seemed a-pity that she should be allowed to drift t\" destruction without a hand being held out to save her. \"I'll give the gentleman your message-but no good ever came of a young girl carrying on with a smart gentleman as drives in his own motor-car. You take my meaning, Miss Jennings?\" Rosa'nodded her head. \"Yes, I understand; but you're making a mistake. I am going to marry the gentleman who is taking me out to dinner to-night-to marry hmu, I tell you.\" Mrs. Tupper laughed-cold, contemptuous laughter.\"I've \"I've heard that tale before.\" \"It's the truth-this time.\" Rosa's eyes flashed. \"My goodness,\" she shrilled out. \"He'll have to agree to marry me, Dickie will, or 'we part company for ever this evening. For I'm no longer a poor girl. I'm rich. I can buy things-the things I want for myself. I needn't make up to anyone any longer. I can snap my fingers at the whole world, and it isn't as if I was one of those silly kids who lose their heads over a fellow. I'm in love with no one really.\" She spoke with such passionate conviction that Mrs. Tupper more than half-believed the statement and turned and left the room, slamming the uoor behind her; and Rosa smiled--a queer, rather bitter smile. \"Yes, it will have to be marriage or nothing; and Dickie's got to understand that, for tl!at's my pricemarriage. Banknotes might have bought me once-but not now.\" She laughed, then fluffed out her curls and pinned on her big hat. She could afford to be virtuous; she had come into seven thousand a year!

Unless soma miracle happens within the next few days there is only one course left open and the way politics are so mixed, perhaps after all, it would be the wisest course, and that is for the Government to appoint Australia's High Commissioner at homns as their representative. There does not seem to be much unity in political forces: every party for itself, and a fight to a finish. We sing \"Australia will be, there,\" but the sentiment is far from the desire in some quarters, and we verily believe that if some had their own way they would drop things and let this great country sink into oblivion, and its famro won by its soldier boys on the battle field pass away without retaining its much-coveted honor. Mr Hughes is undoubtedly the man who should be there. His knowledge of Imperial matters, and those great questions that concerns the overseas dominions, would carry weight in a conference that is met to consider the great problems of business to be conducted after the war, and of which Austialia is as much interested as any of the Biitish possessiohs.","wordCount":414,"illustrated":false}

In Thickness it is to the Earth as the Skin is to the Apple.","fulltext":"OUR BELT OF ATMOSPHERE. In Thickness it is to the Earth as the Skin is to the Apple. In a contribution to the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture, Roscoe Nunn, of the United States Weather Bureau, compares the thickness of the atmospheric envelope that surrounds the earth with the diameter of the earth itself. • The extreme limit of the earth's atmosphere above the surface of the earth is estimated to be 180 miles. The earth's diameter is approximately 8000 miles. But the density of the atmosphere decreases rapidly as altitude increases, so that three-quarters of the mass of tile atmosphere lies below the seven-mile level. Thus the solid earth has but a thin coating of air, at most only about one-fortieth as thick as the diameter of the earth, or if we consider only its really appreciable extent, which is about forty miles above the earth, -only one two-hundredth as thick as the diameter of the earth. It is, therefore, a mere coating, not thicker relatively speaking,.than the skin on an apple of ordinary size. When we consider the fact that storms operate only in that part of the atmosphere which lies within about seven miles of the earth, and chiefly within three miles, it is truly wonderful what mighty forces they generate and what vast energy they expend within that thin film of gas. A storm condition may cover onethird of the United States. The disturbance may be 1000 to 1500 miles in diameter, but less than seven miles thick. In other words, the body of air in which those tremendous forces work is of about the same proportions as a postcard.","wordCount":287,"illustrated":false}

The color of London has a charm peculiar to itself which it retains unaer the most uinpromising skies. Grey days are perhaps greyer, and foggy days:- foggier,' than elsewhere, out blue days and sunny days enjoy a like distinction. The atmosphere of London is. sensitive, taking, on color easily, lending -itself to the reflection of a- summer sky, spinning a web of wonder from, a sunset, or sottening and rounding off every outline when a 'mantle of. fog comes down upon the city. The wonder of the London color is no, new discovery, for it has appealed gently and forcibly to poets and artists, as well as to the hundred and one other individuals, with eyes to see its -beauty. What a list could be made of. its lovers, those who have painted it.and praised it down the centuries. Of course, t owes much of its wonder to the Thames, - to the. breezes that bring_ the mists up from the ocean with the tides, to waft them over the houses;' and much, also, to the smoke which the mists keep from rising on the windless days, for those are. the -days when color reaches its zenith. On windy days, and on those other days, clear as crystal, which are among the sharp surprises of the London atmosphere, 'every detail in the street springs into startling prominence, and the p'eople walk in a rare transparency. -Then the emblazonment of the omnibus, the fanfare of the big advertisements, the coat of gay pamt, used with -a lavishness that formerly belonged only to Southern Europe, but conspicuous all over England to-day upon every door, window-box, or hoarding that offers an opportunity, become too evident; and each cornice, spire, tower and chimney raps out sharply on a hard blue sky.' Then London loses her mystery. Deprived of her silver drapery of mist she no longer presents poetic statements, -but clear facts; her sensitive moods are wholly atmospheric, her cadences come with the vapors and hazes that drift in, over the Essex marshes and Epping Forest, from the sea. Those of her crowd of daily workers who go westward of an evening receive a liberal education in color harmonies, for London's most conspicuous beauty steals over her at sunset. Blazes of color fill the air, welling up out of side streets, and over every roof, merging all outlines behind a web of glowing radiancy. Violet tones Vnd blue tones outvie- those that lie in the folds and valleys of the Alps, when the sun is going down behind the peaks; exquisite greens appear above the purples, and gleams of light come down to create a pavement of amber and pearl in the dubious twilight. Twilight time is the splendid-time for every city; of that there is no doubt, because a city's own lights add so much of magic to the scene, but London relies less than other cities upon her twilight. She can provide a color scheme at any hour of the day: a fog at noon, for instance, when the sun burns like a concealed fire, and earth add sky lose themselves in a haze which varies with every second from burnished copper to sold, from sapphire to rose, or to -a delicate peach bloom,, as the mist is thinned against the grey stones of the buildings. The London atmosphere is, indeed, prodigal with surprises, and changes in the twinkling of an eye. Just now, as if its usual moods were not sufficient, has come the variety of the. darkened streets with a few shaded street lamps, and, above all, the searchlights! The charm of the long streets with their dim vistas of colored lamps is indescribable. The electric light burns through the painted glasses darkly, so that -the ways seem to be hung with Chinese lanterns, which throw warm, strong color on the lower storeys of the buildings, whose upper storeys grow blue and soar away toward the stars, lost in the general clear rich gloom of the night sky. The traffic moves more slowly than usual, the vehicles carry little light, and London becomes resplendent in simplicity. There are fewer people on foot, too, in this city of enchantment, for it is the lighted thoroughfare that attracts the crowd, and there are no lighted thoroughfares in London now. Above . these dusky streets, and without warning, the first feather of the searchlights streams silently upward., Pausing like a comet in midair, or ranging slowly from East to West, 'it remains for a brief moment in undisputed possession of the sky. Thed, like so many silver wands, several more steal out and overarch the dark city. One may rush across the heavens to end in a nebulous blot in the far distance, while another hangs poised in a great fan, steadily lighting up one portion of the sky, or stands majestically upright, a pillar of light, distinct and radiant above its base. One and two, three, four and five are on the scene; and then to count becomes impossible, for throngs of meteors have arisen, and from all points of the compass. As if on the wings of the wind they come and go, mingle and part, while a radiance like the approach of daylight fills the air, soft and silent as the northern lights, and gentle -as a sunrise. Here is a streamer ornamented by a bar of rainbow hue; here, an arch of white with bases at either side of London; there a blushrose feather fanning its edges into fringe as it rushes full tilt up the sky. Making fresh formations and combinations with every half second, they fling themselves hither and thither over twenty or thirty miles of space or, wheeling without a sound, meet to concentrate on a single point, until they seem to be converging ribbons drawn up from the horizon. W'here they meet, an intense white light obliterates everything else, and that is the light which awaits the raider; here he is caught in a noose of light two miles? above the earth. This display, which is the searchlight practice, lasts about half an hour; then, the soft darkness falls, again upon the watchful city as the great streamers \"fold their tents like the Arabs, and as silently steal away.\" -\"And why don't you like her, Mabel?\" \"Because she talks so much scandal. I was dying to tell her about Mrs Jones' goings-on, and about the awful way Mr. Jenkins treats his wife, but she never gave me a chance to get a word in.\" More men fail as preachers by a display of learning than by a lack of","wordCount":1140,"illustrated":false}

The President of the shire Cr. J. Neill, with Crs:Ball,Zwar ahd Pemberton and the secretaf coimprised the delegation. The firme appointeJ I for the meeting Was 11f,30 a.m., but a quorum of Pyalong councillors I were not present, and after.. waiting some time Cr. Greezishields, president of Pyalong shire invited the members of the deputstion to lunch at Griffians hotel. At two p.m. the Pyaloiig president I took the chair, and in welcoming the deputation urged that tie conforence be held before the ordinary I meeting. He was pleased to meet the delegation and whethearany, Ming resulted or not be was sure the meeting would do good. Ca' Neill thank~ed the chairmni and members for their i~elenme, and I called on Cr. Zwar to ohitliue his I scheme. Cr. Zwar tholight it a: goodides .1 for councillors from different ehires to meet in conference. Broadford did not come expecting to gain I anything it was not prepared to give. He considered there was no necessity for a shire to carry on a heavy rate, I if they could get along on a lower I rate. He was very mrch in favor of amalgaimatidn and it vronld be a great benefit to all ratepayers. An engineer was not required, and the shire could cairy on by halinW an engineer on commission 'airid thris so much money would not he reqnired. An engineer was allHight in'd v~ery large shire, but for some years Broadford had found it very satisfactory aesrryilg on utnier the present system. As to a place of meeting he did not care whether they met at Broadforld or Pyalong. Cr Halpin- Get tlhat out of your head; we /ill jot maet at Broadford. Cr. Bull gare in detail an oetline of the proceedings since the Ministers' ordtr to unite Broadlori and Pyalong with Kilmore, and eiplained how both sh'ires had wdrked on a 1/-rate, hbut sooner than go to Kilmore both shiras had increased their rate so as to miaintain their identity. Their was id necessity to hirry in this m itter as both shires had brought their rerednue dp and nothing would hi dodie before Anggst. Be advocated amalgamation so as to davoid the extra rate. No ratepiyar had appeaed against the vailuation btit they did not Sobject to the extra rate. Cr. BalL then read the Broadfo~l. prdposslJ ihichi Wdere almost similar\"to those preseited to Kilmote. He hdped they iwoild consider theise proposals as by working on a lower rate, it oril d be a benefit to both shires. Cir Hialpini suggested one part of B oadfoid shire should go to Kimore : one part to Pyilong, and one part to Yea, but to shift the hall to Broadford be emphatically said No,. SWhlen Mr Adamson came toPyalong I they had to put their hands in their I pocketsand he thought Broadforal should do the sdaie. When Pyalong repi'esentatives wenit to Broadfordl they got a very short Shrift and were told to go andhave a smoke. i. Cr. Figgios remar.ed that though Broadford worked with a consulting Sengineer their salaries were higher than Pyalong. Cr Ball esplaided that Broadford had many smaller matters which Pyalong did not have and that reiruired in ofticer to iook after such as a sanitury system, collecting the dog 'ai and lighting.the street lamps, besides 77~ per cent of their revenue was spent on the roads. CrMceMnuas reniarked that he had two particular foieds- Cr. Telihan and Or.

He was against amalgamation.: Cr. Pemberton said the Ministers proposition in the first place was erude, and the position now was tptally differedt. He emphlat'lly, asserted that the Broadford co:icil wan not responsiblo for anything that had been said by individuals, and the council as a body had done nothing that was not fair toPyaloog. SBroadford dshire had brdought their revenue up and were quite safe, and the only beanefit that would be derived by uniting together would be worklog on a more economical system.

The financial statement wras presented, which showed that after meetin. ill expenses for the current year, theie was. a balance in hind of betweep £2 and £3. A discussion took place iegirding the present p jsition: The new cemetery site has- been eleated of tiimber and partially fenced, bult to complete the fencing and plan arid make the new ground ready for burial pmirposes is estimated to cost at least £50. It is almost .iihsife ndw to use the old cemetery for internient purposes, as lately when opening up new graves the gravedigger has come upon a previous burial. The lax methods and practically .no method or system worked on by the very early cemetery trustees is Sver3y largely responsible for the Frs~nt state of affairs. The trustees realising the urgency of closing the old cemetery as soon as mpossible decided at the meeting to solicit finaifcial aid from the Government, so that the new ground may be thrown open for burial purposes. A suggestion was also made to dispose of the lower portion of the old cemetery adjoining the common ; it is practicalty useless for cemetery purposes owing to it being liable to inundation in winter time, and the secretary was instructed to apply for permission to dispose of same. The election of officers resulted in Mr. Petch (president), Mr. 3M'Liesh (treasurer.), and Mr. Balmer (secretary) being re-elected.

She feels she must nurse him back to health, and she is so full of sympathy that she marries him in order that she may care for him the better. It isn't in the nature of man to do this. He will do anything to help the weak. He will pay for the upkeep of a home for crippled women, but he could never bring himself to marry one of them.

HULME BEAMAN, . allor of \"To-morrow and a Bride.\" Published by Arrangement with Cassell and Co., Melbourne and Lon; (All Rights Reserved.) -CHAPTER III. The Curate is Told of Murder. The curate of Durnley\" sat meditating before the fire in his comfort able study. A book which he had just taken from the shelf lay on the table beside him-not a theological book, ner a work of philosophy, but merely a novel--aFrench novel, too, by a favorite writer of his, Maupaussant's \"Pierre et Jean,\" which happened to be the first volume that came to his hand. Aubrey Anwyl was in the fortunate position of being able to afford a \"study,\" for although he had: been ditstiguished at college for his athletic qualities, he cutibined with tes50e latter iastuillous literary taste without In any sense being a bookworm. lie had furnished a small house on Shis appointment to the curacy of Durnley, which stood midway in the village, a little back from the main street, and fronting a side lane which led through wicket gates across a field path to another section of Durnley. The front rooms of the house looked out on a small gravel patch divided by a high wooden gate from the lane beyond. An elderly woman, acted as the curate's housekeeper, andunder her a young village girl assisted in the housework. The rooms of the house, which was built on old-fashioned lines, were small and low ceilinged, a' narrow stairway leading to the single upper storey. They were furnished, however, throughout with an eye to taste and comfort. A green-shaded reading lamp stood by the curate's elbow, a glass of whisky and water beside him on the table, his slippered feet, as he reclined in an easy-chair, rested on the polished rim of the fender, he had discarded his clerical coat for an old smoking jacket, and a beautifullycolored meerschum pipe was in his mouth. He had finished a late supper, the servants had gone to bed, and it was now ten o'clock. But the curate was not reading the book on the table; he had laid it down and sat staring at the fire with a peculiarly stern and set expressio on, his face. It was a handsome, r ueir'.melancholy, determined fce, with 'resolute features, surmounted by 'thick curly hair over a broad forehead.- Just now its gravity, accentuated y the fitful play of the firelight upon it, had something almost sinister, something menacing, as though his thoughts were engaged on a subject hostile to his sympathies or interests. The house was very quiet, and outside the village had already settled down to its night's repose. Suddenly a sound caught the curate's ear, the sound of a stealthy footstep on the gravel plot in front of the house. He l'stened, and could now distinctly hear in the stillness a cautious footfall outside approaching the lighted window; then it ceased. The curate rose quietly \"and, going to the window, drew aside the curtains and suddenly flung' up the sash. A figure, surprised by this movement, dodged towaris the wall as he did so, but not before the curate had caught a definite glance at the intruder.  \"Now, my man,\" he challenged sharply, \"what do you want?\" From the shadow of the wall a tattered, tall, disreputable form disentangled itself and emerged a step deprecatingly.  \"Beg pardon, sir,\" it -said, in a wheedling voice, \"but seein' a light in here, I Jest come up to- \" \"Beg?\" put in the curate shortly. \"i've bin walking all day, sir,\" whined the. tramp, \"and not a bite of nothin' to eat since the morning, and in this perlshin' cold, too! If you could spare a mouthful of food, sir, to an honest man-and p'r'aps the clergyman could tell me where I could find a shakedown for the night \"I am the clergyman,\" said the curate, cutting him short. \"At least, I am the curate of the parish. The' rector lives in that big nouse lower down. Where have you walked from?\" he asked suddenly. \"I come along the high road from the next village-from Itavensforth,\" tue tramp answered glibly. \"From Ravensforthl\" The curate pondered a moment. \"Then you.must have passed- \" He stopped short, and . regarded 'the tramp in silence. \"What business have you to come prowling up to houses like this?\" he demanded sternly. \"I see the light in your window,\" persisted the vagrant in a stubborn tcne. \"I only wanted to beg a piece of bread and ask where I could get shelter.\" \"Wait a moment,\" said the curate. \"1 will come to the door,': and, shutting down the window, he crossed the hall. to the dining-room,' where from a small cupboard he hastily extracted the remains of a loaf, \"some cheese, and a piece of tongue,-which he miscellaneously wrapped in a sheet of foolscap paper. With these he opened the. front door and confronted the tramp. Framed in the doorway, the curate's tall figure was now .plainly visible to the other, who could distinguish his features in the moonlight. The tramlp's shifty eyes, looking out from a face fringed with a motted b'iia dwelt with almost impudent deliberation on the curate. \"Here you are, my man, -here's some food for you,\" the latter remarked curtly. \"Take it and clear off. I can do nothing more for you. If you want to find shelter for the a?l?it, .inquire at' the village, and I dareay-usame kind of temporary accommodatfo?~Pmay .be provided for you.\" ' ' \"Thank you, sir,\":mumbled,.the vagraint, taking the parcel of food-from Sthe curate's hands; a little ungraclously. \"Beg pardon for troublin' you, sir. I--\" \"Oh, that's all right,\" interrupted the curate impatiently. \"And here's a shilling for you-it will find you a bed somewhere, I. daresay.. Goodnight.\" ' ' Again the tramp mumbled some incoherent Words of thanks,-.and, pocketlng the coin, turned a.nd.shuffled oit of'the gate. SThe curate lookiid after htim a momeat, :\"aw him pass down- thlestreeti, and then, closing the front door, returned to his armchair by the fire. but the incident seemed to have disturbed him oddly. He got up presently and began to pace the room ,-restlessly; poured out another glass of whisky from the decanter, sat down, tooK up his book, flung it down 1, again, hind once : more, with legs stretched in front of him, sat gazing moodily at the fire. it seemed, :.however, that he was not destined to pass the evening without yet a further interruption. This time it came in the shape of . s motor-car, Which stopped with a' t- whirring rush just outside the house. d He remembered hearing a motore car pass and re-pass about half-an= l hour previously, a not very usual ocLt currence, for tew. cars traversed the 3, main street of the village at that s- time of night, as the principal high J. road lay to the left of Durnley. t A hurried step on the pathway, the slamming of the gate, a quick tap on 1- loe window-pane.. heralded the ena trance of Mr. Thorndike, the rector of u Durnley, who without ceremony, let i. himself.in at the front door, which he h found unlocked. y \"'tI didn't want to disturb the sera rants,\" he announced, facing the curate on the threshold. '\"May I come a in?\" f \"By all means, rector.\" The cure ate stepped aside and motioned the a elder clergyman into the snug little e study. \"I hope'nothing has happens ed? You were motoring, I see?\" The 'car had swung slowly around f meanwhile, and was purring swiftly away in the opposite direction. The a curate knew quite well what car it was and whence it had.come. e The rector flung - open his overr coat, put his hat on the table, and e collapsed in a low easy 'chair. He , was a stout, rather florid man, with I grey. side-whiskers and thin hair. Like many ordinarily, placid people, a he was easily worried and irritated by trifles when they conflicted either with his personal or moral comfort. I Any serious emergency utterly seemed to destroy his capacity for practiL cal thought or action. He was agii tated now, bewildered, evidently at a loss. \"Happened!\" Mr. Thorndike looked helplessly around him. \"Yes, i something has happened, something - dreadful, Anwyl. Dreadtul, dreadful! I have just come from the'manor. Sir Alan sent his car for me, and 1 re'tufned in it. I thought I had' better look in and tell you as I passed.\" His eye fell vaguely on the open novel on the table. He took it up and glanced at' it. \"It's a pity you read French novels,\" he added parenthetically. \"Rather debasing literature, I'm afraid, Anwyl.\" The curate sat down in a chair opposite him and regarded the rector with unruffled composure. \"What has happened?\" he asked in a level tone. ' -\"Murder,\" said the rector succinctly. -\"At least, we fear so, we .think so-in fact, there can be no doubt of it. Poor young Burton has been shot dead. His body was found lying on -the road to Carmington, about two miles from - here, close to Cuckoo's Beck--you know the spot? Shot I dead!\" .' The curate did not alter his posi-: tion. His deep-set eyes still . dwelt with a kind of critical scrutiny' on Mr. Thorndike's face. tie seemed not so much interested in the recter's startling news as in the effect of it upon the rector himself. But imperceptibly the lines of his mouth had' hardened and his teeth bit more tightly on the amber louthplece of his pipe, which he had replaced between his lips. The -rector noticed no change in his expression, for. his own gaze was wandering-in a helpless,- ineffectual way from:object to object around him. \"It is very terrible, very terrible!\" he muttered again. \"Poor Burtofi Not a clue either,- not the least clue to the assailantl\" \"When did tLis happen?\" asked Anwyl in his deep, impassive voice. \"This evening. ' Farmer Godby was driving home from Carmington with one of his men at about nine o'clock. tie was the first to find the body of poor Burton lying by the side of the road, near Cuckoo's Beck. He made his man drive on to Barfield for a policeman while he remained by the body. One of the members of the county force returned to the scene in less than half-an-hour, and they took Sthe unfortunate young fellow to his some. Sir Alan was at once informe'd of the tragedy. He sent for me. Poor Arminel is terribly upset-naturally terribly upset. You see, she and her brother.have 'known Fred Burton ever since they were children, and I rather think, toothat at one time there \"wa-,-some, kind of incipiaent - attachment oetween--akemt nothing serious, a mere boy and girl affair, I fancy.\" ' ' / \"'There was never anything beSteen Arminel and Burton!\" broke in Ithe curate almost fiercely. But his voice and manner were again instantly under control. \"She would be upset, of course. Any girl would. You say, rector, that there is no clue to t the assailant? None?\"' \"None.. None whatever.\" Mr. .Thorndike took up the book from the table, examined it closely with una seeing eyes, and put it down again . with. a gesture of resigned perplexity. I \"It is 'very extraoi;dinary, very inexpllcable.. The affair seems to be at - present. a-complete-cmystery. - NaStheory fits it. His gold watch and other jewellery were not touched. He t 'was shot through the heart\" \"Through the heart,\" repeated the scurate musingly..-His eyes were onI Sthe floor, and he raised them slowly Sto the rector's face. \"Could it have a been suicide,.do you think?\"' L ,,aIr. Thorndike shook his head. On -thatone point he seemed to have ar- rived 'at some certainty, some definite conclusion. -'Imposlible,\" hie declared. \"There - aas no weapon , found on him. A rcareful search ,wivas' made, and no weaSpon of any sort was discovered. The a miscreant who shot him must have I made off as fast as he could, and left - poor Burton lying shere.he fell.\" r The rector paused as a sodden thought occurred to him. \"That re: - minds me, Anwyl, didn't you tell me I you intended to walk back froml Carmington thls. evening after'seeing the rural dean?\" , \"Yes,\" said the curate calmly. 1 \"That is so. I dild waRlk back.\" S\"Oh! Do you remember about the s time?\" \"I sholld say-about seven o'clock.\" \"Why, thllen,\" the rector's eyes opened eagerly, \"yoe must lhare passI eId the spot not long'before or after the murder! We assume the crime - was committed at about eight or haIf-iU,\"pas ..\" \"It must have been rather later,\" suggested the curate, frowning. \"I reacheu home at nine.\" \"And you saw nothing-nobodyon the road?\" pursued the rector, anxiously,  \"Nothing-nobody,\" said the curate. -Stay-1 fancy 1 did. pass a man-a figure hurrying along the aedge-but really I took no particular notice of the circumstance.\":' \"That was the man-that was the. ruffian!\" exclaimed Mr. Thorndike excitedly. \"Ah, if you had only known!\" \"How .could I know?\" demanded Anwyl, -a little impatiently. \"Besides, if he had been the assailant, I should have seen the body lying there when I passed the spot\" \"True, true,\"' sighed the rector: \"It is quite inexplicable; at present quite inexplicable.\" He rose in his quick, restless manner and took up his hat. \"I thought you had- better know all about the sad business at once.\", \"Thank you, rector. 'I'm glad you looked in. It was very\"good of yoa. I suppose we can do nothing?\" \"Nothing that I can see. The matter is in the hands of the police. I hope they may succeed in tracing the murderer soon.\" \"I hope so,\" said the curate. And when the rector had gone he returned to his armchair .and again sat staring moodily into the fire, till its glowing .embers sank to ashes and the lamp burnt low: CHAPTER IV. ' Is It a Clue? Fred Burton, the young Squire of Barueld, had been on the whole a popular figure in the county. He had certainly the reputation of being rather \"wild,\" but he was well on, 1had- been educated at a public school, and with many personal at- I tractions combined a disposition superlicially good-natured and sociable. His mother and sister, with whom h lived in a large house between Barfield and Durnley, had latterly regarded with some apprehension a growing tendency on Burton's part towards excessive drinking. When in his cups the young squire had been usually rather quarrelsome and reckless in manner and speech, and on more than one occasion had committed indiscretionq which had brought him into serious conflict with his 'neighbors. In most cases these lapses had been generally forgotten I and forgiven, for he himself was the first to regret them subsequently. Yet in all this no explanation could now be found for the sudden- tragic end of the young man, and universal indignation was expressed against the unknown assassin. One of the loudest to denounce the murderer and the most zealous in his determination to trace him was Dennis Escort.Fred Fred Burton had been an old friend of his. They had played together as boys. As young men they had shared many a merry escapade. The feeling was quite atural. The exclamation of horror with which Deniofs had first heard .the .news was echoed by others in the neighborhood.  Early the following - morning Dennis motored into Carmington to make inquirei .' He was the first to bring the intellience-to the Brayfords-thle rich banking family with whom the Escotts had for many years been on terms of ,some intimacy.  Ethel Brayford, a handsome, imper1ous, dark-eyed girl of twenty-two, was a friend of Arminel's; -and since his return from Canada Dennis had fallen in love with her. At first she had refused him, but Dennis swore he would marry her, and by -his obstinate, passionate courtship had at length almost prevailed upon the proud girl to change her mind. . So far at least she had yielded that she permitted his 'attentions in a careless, half-contemptuous spirit. She liked Dennis, but was not in love with him. She liked, too, the idea of becoming- eventually a baronet's lady, but she would be an heiress, and could, to some, extent, pick and choose her suitors. \"Burton has been shot,\" announced Dennis, standing before her with a rather haggard face. \"Poor old Burton . . last night-on the Carming. ton road, as he was walking home.\" \"Mr. Burton-shot?\" repeated Miss Brayford; regarding him incredulously. \"Why, it was: only yesterday afternoon that I-saw him in the High street, and he stopped and spoke to us. .' You don't mean-shot dead?\" Dennis made'a hopeless gesture.-I \"Yes-right through the heart It's frightful. I was -with him in, the afternoon, too1-Just after I left you. We-I came across Ferris, and had dinner- with him before he left for town. We can't get.hold of any clde to the murderer. I'i' trying to find out what I can-but there doesn't seem to be any sort of clue.- A Scotland Yard man is coming down, I believe.\"  \"Well, I'm terribly sorry to hear it.\"' replied- Miss Brayford, contracting- her handsome- eyebrows. \"Poor Mr. Burton!' How- fearfully' sad-and how fwful for his:mother and sister! And:little Arminel,'\" she added, after a pau~ge., \"Arminel used to be rather folnd-6of Mr. Burton a few years agobefore--\" She did not ,complete the sentence Ybut. smiled significantly. \"Oh,' Arminel hlas no thoughts for anyone in-the world at-present except Anwyl, -said-Dennis with a short laugh. '\"Of course, she was a bit ,bowled over by the news.. - We all were. By heaven! I'wish I could lay hands on the murderer!\" \"Oh, I expect the man will be found sooner or later,\" commented Miss Brayford,: without much - emotion. \"They always are, you know.\" \"Do you think so?\" asked Dennis, with sudden anxiety in his dark eyes. \"Do you really think so, Ethel?\" 'Yes. . believe in the old saying: 'Murder will out!'\" \"But there is no. clue,\" persisted Dennis. \"No clue at all.\" \"Not yet, perhalps. But there will be.\" She spoke with such an air of calm conviction that the young man was obviously impressed. His eyes roved restlessly around the room; he thrust hil hands deep into his pockets and nolddedl gloomily. \"I hope so,\" hlie mumbled. \"I'd give anytlhing. .. . Well, good-bye, Ethel.\" lie turned;l swiftly and held out his handl. \"1 m5ust be off. Will you come over to so to-morrow? Mother asked mlle to ask you. and Army wants to Ilhve a chat withl you, too. I'll comoe anol motor you dlown. if you likle?\" \"Tlhalnks. I thlink I will, but I can't promise. There's a big dance on in the evening.... Well, good-bye.\" Dennis left, and for the next hour wandered from club to club dlscuss ing the tragedy with various acquaintances, but without eliciting any information that could throw a light on the mystery of .Burton's:death. Burton had been at Carmington all tli preceding afternoon. Many mu-. tual acquaintances had seen him. But nobody could speak definitely with regard to his movements. He -very often walked home to Barfield when the weather was fine. There was nothing unusual ti-that. He had probably dined at one of the-hotels-and so on, and so on-but nothing definite. A'\"Nothing \"Nothing definite, nothing defihite!\" Dennis kept' repeating with a curious mental emphasis. No;-there was' not likely to be anything definite, unless Ferris . . . He reached the manor and reported no progress. The police were still busy. The inquest was fixed for the following' morning, after the post mortem' had taken, place., Sir Alan, of course, wiould be present.' And it might be as well for Dennis to. be present, too-- Yes oDennis said he would 'certainly attend. Poor Burton! The fact to' be established at the inquest was a very simple one-how the unhappy young squire had come by his death.. The medical- evidence was .quite conclusive on this point. The pistol bullet had been found embedded in the right lung, after passing laterally and downwards through -the ventricledof the heart.\" The shot -must:have been fired from tbe direction of the left side, and probably at close' quarters. It- was not impossible' for the shot 'to have been fired by the victim himself, assuming that-he held the pistol in his-left hand-but the general direction and position of the wound made this extremely unlikely. The bullet was produced, and would, of course, be preserved by the authorities.  So far, then, as the cause of death was concerned, there was no diff.culty. -But the real mystery remained-who fired the shot,, and under what circumstances? On these questions not much' light was thrown ' by: the. preliminary inquiry; and indeed it was not the business of the coroner's jury to investigate 'them.:- That rested with the police. 'One or two witnesses, however, were called-and Dennis Escott was among them. He had seen' Mr. Burton on the afternoon of that day? Yes, Dennis had. \" \"Had, in fact, actually been in the dead man's company?\" Dennis admitted that this was so. \"Mr. Escott,\" said the coroner, \"will you kindly tell us as concisely as possible exactly what you personally know of. Mr. Burten's; movements on that afternoon?\" Dennis, who was seated in a chair at the end of a long table, around which were ranged the jurymen, with the doroner at'its head (the-inquiry was taking place in' the dining-room of the Burtons' own house), looked about him. a little uneasily. He seemed at a loss quite how to begin. He twirled ltis heavy moustache nervously, and cleared his throat once or twice. -\"Well, the fact is,\" he said after a pause and speaking in quick, jerky sentences, \"I haven't an absolutely distinct recollection of details. As far as I remember, I came across Mr. Burton at about four o'clock in the High street, Carmington. He was then- walking with a friend of ours, Mr. Ferris, -with whom later on I dined. I met him in' the billiardroom of one of the hotels-the White Lion-half an hour 1 ter, and we played a game of billiards together. - I fancy he had a business appointment at five. He left me and I dined with Mr. Ferris at the club.\" \"And,\" put in the. coroner, as Dennis paused, \"you did not see Mr. Burton again that evening?\" \". No,\" was the abrupt answer. S':You can offer no suggestion as to whom he may have subsequently met and walked back with?\" \"None.\" \"\"Had he ,led you to suppose that he had any enemies-anyone, for intance, with'whofn he may have been on bad terms, or quarrelled??\" Dennis considered a' moment; but shook his head. . .\"No,\"- he answered slowly, \"I can think of nobody.\" -\"This Mr. Ferris you mentionwho is he?\" \"He. is a friend 6f mine; a man I knew: in Canada He is staying in SLondon\" and .comes down to Carmington-eoccaBlonally. I saw him off to town: .that evening.\" \"Mr. Burton knew him Swell, too?\" \"Fairly well-in a casual way. I had introduced them to each other,\" . Then there came the fjrst dramatic Imoment 'of the inquiry. \" . \"Do'you know,\" said the coroner gravely, \"that a glove has been found to-day -by the police very near the spot where Mr. Burton was shot?\" \"A-glove?\" Dennis gave a perceptible start and. gazed at the coroner with something almost like fear. in his darkl.eyes. - \" \"No, I didn't know that. I had not' heard of it.'! An.-inspector of police stepped forward at 'a sign from the coroner and handed him something.= The coroner passed it along to Dennls:  \"Mr. Escott,\" hle\" asked gravely, \"cas- you. telL,.us wholthat glove belongs to?\"(To (To b`e Continued.)","wordCount":4118,"illustrated":false}

All the leading war makers seem to be ashamed of the war. \"I didn't. do it,\" says-the Kaiser; \"I'm not so much to blame as people think\"which probably is true. \"Everybody knows we did not begin this war,\" declares Count Tizsa, the Hungarian Premier, which exactly contradicts the best information. Count Reventlow\\ and General Bernhardi will \"be the next to speak up and disown the Great Calamity. One even reads that Germans at the front resent the wide diffusion of the idea that Germans have been inhumane and brutal. \"We know,\" says. one of, them, \"that: we are called Huns and barbarians. I'can say it has not softened our-feelings5 any, nor will it.\" One detects the impression that the war has not brought the credit that was expected. Alas for this poor war! only two years old, and so ugly and disfigured that no one wants to father it. It was not so with Germany's three previous wars. Bismarck was the father of-all three of them, and proud of his get, as Germany was proud of him. Statues a-plenty now stand in his honor. But the intolerable anguish and disrepute of this present war has reached back even to Bismarck. His statues seem to blush. The bully is fading out of the very_ bronze that shapes him. Too bad! Too bad!' A-war from which so much was hoped, such glory, such booty, has turned out a crushing disappointment. Said the \"high German officer\" who resented being called a Hun: \"The more the world howls for our destruction the harder we will fight, and the last Englishman will have to face the last German. We are neither Huns nor barbarians, and if severe measures were resorted. to by us they were the' outcome of the most serious military necessity.\" Sad words and vain!. The sack of Louvain; the 'estruction of Rheims Cathedral; the 'murder of thousands of Belgian non-combatants; the rape of Belgian women by the hundreds; the sinking of the Lusitania-\"serious 'miliary necessity\" an excuse for such crimes and innumerable. others? No, High Officer; not on your life. If you beck such details of the game of 'war then you must expect to be rated as a Hun and a barbarian. Very likely you are neither, and perhaps you are an honest gentleman. But if you are, how can such as you be separated from the' Germans whose brutality calculated and compelled the horrors in Belgium? It is not the English, nor the French, nor the Russians, nor the Belgians, that have smeared infamy on the Germans. Germans did it. Nobody else could have done it. You, High Officer, when you finally settle for that offence against Germany, must settle with Germans. It is they .who nave polluted theircountry's character. But alas for' the poor war! so young and in such disrepute that no one will fatier it. Perhaps history will be of the mind of Lowes Dickinson, that it was begotten on Europe by the European anarchy, and cme in due time to an inevitable birth For Mr. Dickinson's theory is that the way Europe has been managed since the fifteenth century was bound to bring on wars from time to time; that all the governments were to blame for this war (as the Kaiser also admits), and that if Germany was removed from Europe to-morrow there would be a new war presently be tween the Power's that were left. He wants the system changed, and advocates the League to Enforce Peace. Well, yes; the League to Enforce Peace.

A crowded house attended the efforts of the recruiting committee in launching forth their first public mieeting for the year, and in suno port of the great work no w being put forth to obtain recruits to ireinforce the Anzacs at the front. The President of the shire presided and in opening the m:eting asked all present to sing the National 1Anthem, A film of picturesHeroes of the Dardanelles-was then screened : the landing at Gillipoli, fightiig the Turks, were heartily rapplauded. Speeches t ete then made by Lieut. Holder, i Sergt. Rabey, and Mr.J. B. Stewart of Rutshworth: Stirring appeals were made by each speaker, and partictilarly by Mr Stewart, who with -all the forceftilness at .his coriiziand, pointed out the absolute necessity of sending away to give the boys at the front that much needed help. Australia was as much in danger as any othei of the British possessions, and they mustgive of their, best to win this war, and if they could not give any help by. man power then they conld help with their money by investidg iii the war loan. Mr. Stan. Baker was to the fore with a coiple of patriotic songs, and another reel of pictures was screened. At the conclusion of the meeting an appeal wais made for recruits, but notie came forward A vote of thanks to the 'speakers and all who had 'helped towards the success of the meeting was passed on the -motion of Messrs. J, G. Pemberton and F. W.- Petch. The Seymour camp band. under Bandmaster J, Jarvie rendered several selections at the hall and in the march, and were given three hearty cheers by the audience.

Water Trust ireting. The mionthly meeting of the above. trust wasi held on Wedneslay, Com. Pemberton in'the chair. Co'rrespoudence was received .fron Water Comrnissien re amount doe in connection with the loan, and from Waterworts Trust association f re laws enacted in connection wi.th the sederage questions etc. . Mr J. H. Nicholls complained of being without w'ater on days when his neighbors had plenty and not being able fo find out the cause asked that the caretaker inspect the pipes at his place. The secretaiy reported there was a balance at the bank of £461 9/5. The accounts with the payments to be passed amounted to £313 5/10 leaving a balance of £151 3/7. The Caretaker reported tha works in good order. The reservoir had got very lA 'dauring the week but was now f;lling up quiskly. The reports and correspondence were receivej. Corn. Bull remarked that it was a risialnoccurrenre at this time of the year, for the reservoir to get empty, liht they were fortunate- in having a break in the weather and by the report it was seen that the reservoir was filling rapidly. In connection with thecomplaint from Mr Nicholls he had no water while his neighbors lad plenty. At his place there was a good pressure on, but Mr Nicholls did not get any water till the evening. Next morning there was hardly any in the tap, and the following niorning it was a little better. In asking the caretaker the reason he was told that there was only a foot or two of water in the reservoir, so it could 3e plainly seen where the water was going. There was evidently too mnich irrigation going on. Com.:J. M, Neill, sail he was having a look around the head works and everything was working very satisfactory. The shortage made it very inconvenient on the high levels for householders because they did not get . mneh of a pressure, while those on the lower levels fared better. Althongh this was a matter that did not affect them very much now, yet he thought the trust would have to step in and veto irrigating lucerne i dd maize It had been suggested that more storage should be reserved but the Way the water was being used he did not think the Sunday Creek itself would supply the needs of all. Cr. J. Neill said he had to admit that he was one of the guilty. He was paying a big rate and considered he had as much right to water his small plot of lucerne as the nursery had to water their plantation, where the taps were running for full six hours in the day. He thought they should consider improving the reservoir so as to carry more water. The trust ,was in a good financial position and the matter should lie considered. - Corn. Treaise considered it wouild not be a wise policy to enlarge the reservoir so as- to enable people to irrigate. As long ia there was a sofficiency for a domestic supply they ihonld not interfere. Com. Bull srid ihey could very will let the matter drop this year, but some adtion siould be taken by ,.the triist to prohibit irrigation. If there is no green ituff grown the I ater will riot be i;eqdired add there ivill be plety I ftr i doniestid sipply.

Hte believed that if the hollirig capacity of the reservoir wras enlarged there would besoffcient for all purposes. The usual accounts were then passed for payment. Com.-Bull. mentioned that after the accounts had been paid they would have a balance of £150 in Shand, .and as they would not be requiring the money for fully six months some of it should be put away earning interest. Members ofthe trust agreed and it was left to the secretary to invest £125 either on deposit with the Colonial Bank or the State Savings Bank. the meeting then adjourned.

Remember that in'nine cases out of ten it.is excessive acidity that causes stomach -]ain, and that drags and medicines should ohly be used when the stomach is actuanhlly diseased, which rarely isathe case, and then only on. your physician's advice. Dregs may numb the pain, but the sense of security and well being they give you is usually false because they do not destroy the acid which almost invariably is the cause of the trouble. There is really only one preparation which can be relied upon to do this,and that is bisurated mi goesia, whiclfmost chemists stock it. powder and tablet form. Half a .teaspoontul of bisurated magnesia powder or two. compressed tablets takeu with ajittle wqter after meals will. neutralise the acid instantly, and also prevent all possibility of the food fermenting in the stomach.

An account of the welcome given to a British regiment in Mysore, India, is contained in a letter written by a soldier in a Lancashire regiment to his home. At the municipal boundary, the-writer says, we were met by the three bands of His Highness the Maharajah, and we passed under a triumphal arch with the bands playing \"The British Grenadiers.\" It enlivened' our progress through streets gay with bunting and amid shouts of welcome. Every possible honor was accorded to us in a reception such as can rarely have been given to a British regiment in the annals of history. We were conducted through the beautiful Curzon park on to the ground immediately facing Government House: In marquees on each side of the drive a banquet fit for a king was spread. Afterwards conveyances of all kinds were placed at our disposal-motor, cars, horse, camel and bullock gharries. What a merry lot we were! Our tour through the city was one of unalloyed delight, the Royal zoo, with its magnificent collection, the royal stables, garage, sumer palace, all being thrown open for our entertainment. At 6 p.m. His Highness, escorted by a wonderfully picturesque and soldierly mounted escort, in attractive uniforms of yellow and black, rode up and received a royal salute from the British troops, who were reviewed We gave him three British cheers, with helmets off, such as he had never heard before.A brief march through the streets of the city brought us to Hardinge circle, and then to the courtyard of the Maharajah's palace. The magnificent building suddenly burst into a blaze of glorious light-some 15,000 electric globes shone from every line, every nook and corner into the night, providing a spectacle of regal brilliance. Our comanding officer told us that His Highness, to accord us the greatest possible honor, would permit us to go over his palace. We were impressed into silence as we filed along the galleries of choice marble, under ceilings beautifully moulded, delicately tinted and gilded. Passing doors of sandalwood and silver, carved and chased, we entered the tnrone room, containing the brilliaqt 1Sysore throne. It is made of chased gold and set with diamonds presented to an old-time ruler by one of the Emperors at Delhi. It rests on four golden lions whose eyes are flashing rubies. A flight of silver steps leads to the seat, which has cushions of gold cloth. Tassels of ropes of pearls hang from the arms. Above these is a golden umbrella with fringe of pearls, set with dazzling gems, and on the top of it perches a golden parrot set with emer. aids and diamonds, holding an emerald pendant in its beak. Then we passed into the state room, which held every eye in sheer delight as we gazed on the luxurious furnishings. We left the gorgeous palace awe-inspired by its beauty, and were glad to give vent to our feelings when the colonel called for three more cheers for His Highness. Torch bearers met us and accompanied us 4% miles back to camp, which we reached with thoughts of abiding gratitude. It was a \"long, long way,\" but we shall never forget what such loyalty to Britain means.","wordCount":557,"illustrated":false}

Toe idea swats that the Commonwealth shcild supply rainforcerbenti numbering 1j,500 a mouth, the offi'ial figures show the number of men who enlisted in the first four w?eks of 1917 to a 4214.

As the older Stai s:pp!ied 1683' of .the 4124 who went into -camp in January, the felling offtin that State is a serious in.tte'. Otha.r points whioh have to he borne in I mind are that the arts of the orator, I the artist, the buttonholer are well 'nih exhausted, and reoruitirg officers point oun that a surpri iogly large propartin off thos, coming forward are youths who have heeo waitiong to attain their majority These', Iads' are fired by the same heroi? spirit .which animated those who went to G.llipoli; indeed it may feirly.be written of them that they go, if not with a higher coirage, that in.most cases would be impossible, at least wirh.a fuller knowledge of how slow and how oruel a thing this great struggle is.

It is` interesting then to note the attitude of the Labor Leagues. The Exeedtive of the P.L C. stated. suavely that it had nothing to say on the supremely important subject of enlistment, except that those oonneoted with its organisa ion might please themselves. A few days ago a Hlenty League supplemented this bald utterance a little. It declared that it could take no part in the recruiting campaign, and it gave two reasons for its inaction. One, is that it suspects employers of introducing economic conscription, the other that it thinks the time ripe for the making; of pe3ee over. turre.

Tlh talk about economic conscription is specially ridiculous.

This matter was alluded to at a conference of the local recruiting committee to discuss nmatters concerning the recruiting movemetntt in' this shire, and the opinion was expressed that action should. be taken. and a miution was tabled that the Direoior General- of Recruiting I be urged to impress the Federal Governom'nt with the necessity of , putting a stop to speeches which was prejudical to recruiting. To' the great majority it is suiprising that some action hli not been takeis by the ,authorities \"to suppress it.

After receiving the re. fund, miany were subsequently cured by continouing the remedy. The proprietors of W.R.R. in Australia (who have been Dr. Wright's agents for nearly -10 years) continue to issue a signed guarantee with six bottles, no matter how severe or apparently hopeless the case appears. In ordinary cases 2 or 3 bottles generally effect a cure. The price of a bottle sufficient for one month's treatment is 5/6. Your chemlist or storekeeper will get it for you, and, if 6 bottles are bought right out, they will give you a legally binding guarantee to refund your motney in full if set cured.

CHAPTER XXIII. \"To think that you have come bac, to me, Debonair-that we are going to be married, after all; and I made so sure that if I lost my money-I should lose you-that you would not feel justliled in marrying a penniless girl on account of Manor Court-that you would teel bound to marry money. It was because I felt so certain that I should lose my heritage that I broke with you, my dear, within a few hours of our getting engaged. I couldn't bear to think that I might be saddling you with a penniless wife; but it would have been much better-I see that now-if I had ma.e a clean breast of things to you from the start-told you everything.\"  Rachel spoke in soft, dreamy tones. She wa sitting on a 'sofa in the drawing-room of the Red House and Debonair sat by her side, and it was easy to tell from the look on their faces what had happened. A tragic misunderstanding had been put right at last. Lovers who disbelieved in each other had been orought together again.The. The. sun was setting in the skysetting in a haze of golden flame, and through the open window came the heavy scent of flowers-the spicy odor of pinks and mignonette-the warmer and more fragrant perfume of roses, and, afar, amongst the branches of the elm trees, rooks could be heard cawing wisely to each other, and once or twice from the distant woods came the low, soft note of the cushet dove. \"Oh, my darling-my dear, proud, beautiful darling!\" Debonair slipped an arm about Rachel's waist as he spoke and drew her to him. \"You ought to have known me better. You ought to have felt assured that it was you I wanted-not your money; but, never mind, my sweetheart, everything is all right now. We understand each other at last. I am no longer jealous of Philip Deerhurst -honest old Phil-and you realise now, don't you, that I was not making love to Rosa Jennings that evenIng when I met her outside Moryst Farm. Of course, .was a fool to kiss her that night, but I was feeling so wretched, Rachel. You see, you had just thrown me over, and I believed that Rosa really cared for me. I gave her credit for possessing a heart.\" \"A heart.\" Rachel shook her head. .\"That's the one thing that Rosa Jennings certainly doesn't possess, for, oh, how vilely she nas behaved-how shamefully-in getting engaged to you whilst she was a poor girl and then throwing you over. directly she found that she was Mr. Jordan's daughter-a great heiress. Oh, I could shake the little wretch when I think,how shamefully she has treated you, Debonair, and yet I am exceedingly grateful to her-more grateful than I can say, for 'suppose Rosa had held you to your engagement? What should we have done?\" Rachel laughed as 'she spokebright, tuneful laughter-and looked at her over with happy, fearless eyes, and Debonair smiled in his turn. \"I'm sure I can't say, Rachel; but I don't think I could have married Rosa knowing that you loved me. In fact, I'am certain I couldn't. T should have had to ask Rosa to release me from my engagement-made a clean breast of everything to her.\" \"But suppose she had declined to release you?\" \"Oh, that wouldn't have happened.\" Debonair laughed. \"Rosa would have been obliged to give me up. Sh couldn't hgve married me against my will, anyway. But, still, things are much better as they are, are they not? By Jove! you cannot imagine how dazed I felt when I got mother's letter yesterday telling me what a muddle I had made of everything; and the old lady let me have it pretty straight, I can tell you. She made me realise what a blind owl I had been. But isn't it an extraordinry thing, Rachel, the change that has come over mother during the last two days? She no longer puts the immense value on money that she used to do. She is beginning to believe that there is something better than money in the world-that love is the one thing needful-love.\" Debonair's voice softened as he said the last words, then he raised Rachel's hand to his lips and kissed her slim, pale fingers tenderly. \"Good Lord! how happy we are going to be, my dear. What a grand life lies ahead. The fates have been more than kind to us, I think, Rachel. They have got us out of our tangle, splendidly.\" \"Yes, it was a tangle, wasn't it?\" Rachel laughed. She paused a sec. and, then leaned toward her lover. \"Tell me, dear, after you got your mother's letter and had read it and found out that I loved you, what did you feel, knowing that you were engaged' to Rosa JenningsT- ' \"I felt like a fool-a damn fool,' and I cursed myself horribly. Oh, you can have no idea.what a blessed re'iet it was when the second post brought me Rosa's letter-the coldblooded epistle in which-she broke off our engagement. I never felt more grateful to anyone in my life than I did to Rosa.\" \"And then what did you do-after you had read Rosa's letter?\" \"I got a Bradshaw to find out which train would bring me down here the quickest. But a question in my turn, Rachel. Were you surprised when I turned up here last evening, 'or did your heart tell you that I was coming? Did you know?\" Rachel blushed--a warm blush. \"Yes, Debonair, I hoped you would come to me last evening, but I wasn't sure--I couldn't say. I thought you might feel bound to Rosa. I was afraid-oh, most dreadfully afraidthat she would keep you to your engagement; but in my distress I call. ed unto the Lord and He heard me. I prayed to God that He would put matters right between us, and He answered my prayer-He sent you back to me. He has given us to'each other, for you are mine, Debonair, and I am yours.'\". Rachel folded her hands together as she said the last words-folded them in the attitude of prayer, and Debonair realised that. she was thanking God inwardly for what He had done for her and her lover; her face looked very beautiful at the moment--curiously\" exalted. \"Oh, my dear,\" he-murmured, his voice low and husky with. embtion. \"I don't feel half worthy of you. Indeed, Rachel, you have done a fine thing in surrendering your fortune to Rosa Jennings-in giving up your Inheritance.\" 'I have only done what I believe to be right;',\" Rachel answered slow. ly. \"The place does belong to her, Debonair, and so does the money; but it hurts me a little to think of leaving home and saying-good-bye to the Red House. But, still, I must not grumble; only I do hope=-oh, I hope most earnestly that Rosa wll loolc after the poor people when she comes to live here-that she will be kind to them-that she will do her duty by. the land.\" Debonair shrugged his shoulders. \"I hope so, too, Rachel,\" he answered, \"but, somehow, I have my doubts. I fear the only person Miss Rosa will think about in the future will be herself.\" \"She is coming down' to the Red House to-morrow, you know. I got rather a curt letter from her this morning, say that she would be motoring down with a friend just to have a look around, and that she wants to take possession by the end of the week. She gives me a week to clear out.\" - \"Good Lord! Can she write to you like that?\" Debonair exclaimed. The blood flew to his forehead. \"My darling girl, how ungrateful-howhow vile!\"\"Oh, \"Oh, I don't suppose ?she means to be unkind, and, of course, her head is a little turned, and that's only natural, isn't it, Debonair? But, anyway, I must leave the Red House in a week's time, and, of course, it will be a little bit of a'wrench.\" \"A wrench? I should think it would be a wrench; but you will come straight to us, sweetheart, when you leave the Red House, won't you? You will make.your home at Manor Court till we are married? I know that's what mother wants you to do; and we can be married in a month's time, can't we? We will have the quietest of all quiet weddings, and we'll spend the first weeks of our honeymoon on the sea, for you are as keen on going out to Canada as I am, are you not, Rachel?\"  \"Yes, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be married in.a month's time, and I feel sure I shall love Canada and the life there. My dear father-for I shall always think of Mr. -Jordan as my father-used to talk to me so \"much about Canada, and tell me what a grand land it iswhat a splendid country. I am certain we shall get on and make our farm pay.\" \"You won't hate saying good-bye. to England-to this beautiful home; and all the comforts and luxuries with which you have bqen surround-' ed from your girlhood up? You won't regret not having married Phil Deerhurst?\"  \"I would rather marry you than be Queen of England, Debonair,\" she answered slowly; \"and you know that, my dear, you know it.\" . He looked her straight in the eyes add realised that she was speaking the truth; but Debonair regretted, all the same, that he could give Rachel so little in the 'future-so 'little except his love, and he suddenly understood how his mother felt about Manor Court; for it came upon him in a flash how hard it would be to have to sell the old house in the future-the home which by rights should have belonged to his children and his children's children, but which must now become the property of strangers. A shadow crossed his face, but he drove it away with a smile, for, after all, he was marrying the woman he loved-he was putting love before everything. CHAPTER XXIV. \"Well, I'm quite enjoying myself, and I don't mind saying so.\" Rosa smiled and drew the folds of her pink chiffon motor veil coquettishly about her face, then she gave one of her odd, discontented laughs. She was lolling back in Captain Melton's big white \"Silent Knight,\" for Dickie was motoring her down to Kent to spend the day at the Red House, and the fairies had really been exceedingly good to the vain, self-indulgent, selfish girl, for Rosa had not only come into a great fortune, but she would be able to call herself the Duchess of Ludlow one day, for Dickie had done what was expected of him-he had formally proposed to Rosa and been accepted.  Rosa certainly looked astonishingly pretty this morning, and Captain Melton fel' quite proud of his pretty companion, the girl he had first come across in a beauty shop, but whom he could introduce to his people with some degree of confidence next week -for Rosa would be safely installed by then in the Red House, and he could boast that he was marrying a very considerable heiress; and though Dickie knew-Just as Rosa: knew-that marriage had ceratinly not been in his thoughts at the commencement of their acquaintance, what did that matter now? Rosa was no longer a poor little friendless shop.girl; she had become a person of importance. \"I'm enjoying myself, too,'-Rosa. This is awfully Jolly, isn't it, little girl?\" Dlckie smiled. Like Rosa, he was feeling particularly pleased with things. He was going to marry a girl he really liked-a girl who would come to him so well dowered that society would really ,not be able to offer any formidable objections to the match. Besides, by the time he came into his title, people would have forgotten that the Duchess of Ludlow had ever served in a beauty shop. They would only rememberor judge it wisest to remember-that Ross had been a considerable heiress in her own right, the heroine of a romantic history, and' though she had a common manner, Dickle was quite certain that Rosa's pert audacity would prove attractive to the younger and more rapid members of the smart set. Besides, she wasn't a fool. She would soon acquire a certain amount of veneer. She would learn to suppress her high, unmeaning laugh-to conquer her natural vulgarity, and her looks would carry her through. Why, men would rave about Rosa presently, when sihe was the Honorable Mrs. Mtelton, and women-even fair, proud women born and bred in the purple-would have to admit that the future Duchess of Ludlow was certainly pretty in her own way, as pretty as paint. So Dickie argued, lolling back at his ease in the big car, quite convinced that the gods had been dealing kindly by him as well as by Ropa, and aware that he had done nothing to deserve his good fortune, for he had led a lazy, profligate life, but full of vague notions as to the desirability of reforming his ways in the future and becoming a model husband and father. \"I hope you like my get-up, Dickie?\" Rosa glanced up at Captain Melton, making her eyes very large and round. 'T've spent.no end of money upon my clothes, so I want you to say that I do you credit. Everything I've' got.on is brand new and comes from the most expensive -shops.\" . The vulgar speech jarred on the young man a little. He would have tolerated it in Rosa Jennings, but he did not like his future wife to talk like this. However, he must take Rosa as he found her, and, certainly, her pale pink straw motoring bonnet with the long tulle veil floating behind suited her to perfection, and -Dickie admired Rosa's very smart and well-cut white mnoire coat. She had pinned -some pink malmaisons into the belt of her coat, and her dress was a clinging white lingerie affair, with a touch of pink ribbon at the throat and waist -a pale floating end of pink ribbon. \"What do you think of my earrmigs?\"-. Rosa smiled at her future husband and touched one of the pink coral and diamond ear-rings she was wearing-ear-rings she had only.just purchased. \"Your ear-rinks-they're ripping. They suit you down to the ground.\" \"You must buy me some nice Jewellery.\" Rosa spoke with the manner of one conferring a favor. \"I want a really good pearl necklace and 'some diamonds.\" - \" \"You shall have everything you want.\" Dickle pressed Rosa's plump cool little hand underneath the rug. -He knew that she was greedy. He vaguely realised that she only liked or appeared to' like people for what she could get out of them, and that she was simply marrying him for the sake of his title and great position in the future-trading her kisses; but he could not shake off her chains. He was the slave of her soft scented flesh. He loved her for her blue eyes and golden curls and warm, white little body. She had subdued him through his senses. She possessed the spells of youth and beauty -spells that enslave- a man and make him weak as water, and he could not escape from Rosa. He had. tried to make a plaything of her -a pretty plaything, but Rosa had fluttered out of his reach and then ca'st her net over him, and now he was her captive-her natural prey. The big car tore on, flashing down green lanes and passing hedges hung with wild clematis-ascending hills land tearing along the white high road--raising great clouds of dust, and Rosa swelled with importance. This was the right way to travel, she told herself-sitting in a fine big car and occupying nearly the whole of the roadway-scorching along at break-neck speed-taking no heed of humble folk-the poor foot passengers, beyond covering them with dust and flashing past like an express train. She gloried in the sense of triumph-of conquest. She felt as if she had suddenly become a being of superior ' clay-a crowned queen of the earth. She looked at . the cotStage women disdainfully as the big car dashed madly through quiet villages. She laughed when two ladies driving along slowly in a pony chaise ,had almost to take refuge in the ditch. She expressed scant concern when the car ran over a dog and killed it on the spot, for Rosa felt that nothing should be allowed to interfere with her pleasures-her amusements. She liked driving fast, therefore let the.car race on. What did the feelings of the rest of the world matter? -She grew very.excited when actually within' a few miles of the Red House, and more full of her own importance than ever, but her excitement made her eyes shine lilke stars, and her cheeks flushed a lovely pink. \"It' will be a bit awkward meeting that girl Rachael Taylor,\" she admitted. . \"But I don't intend to let her think she's done anything so out of .the way in handing over my own money to me, my father's fortune. She'd have been no better than a common thief if she had kept the Smoney, and I don't mind telling her so to her face.\" \"I shouldn't do 'hat,\" Dickie advised. \"I think Miss Taylor has behaved quite splendidly, and you ought to do something handsome for her-hand her over a few thousands, anyway.\" ,tosa made a wry'face. \"I thought of helping her a bitbut I don't know; the money's mine -she's got no real right to it.\" Rosa pulled rather sharply at her motor veil. \"Tell the chauffeur to drive faster, Dickie. I want to tear along the road like the wind, for I'm driving to my own home, and I feel that excited.\" She drew a deep full breath. Her breast was heaving. She could hardly control her impatience. 'She longed so to walk into the Red Houseto take .possession-queen it. Lin her own home,. \"We are running quite fast enough, I think. There's a nasty hil ahead.\" Dickle smiled at is excited little companion, admiring Rose's flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes-telling' himself how pretty she was--how devilish pretty; but she put an eager hand upon his arm. \"Going fast? Nonsense! We're crawling. Tell the chanuffeur to buck .up a bit. I'm all impatience now to get to the Red House. I'm so keen to show you my home. Let the car rip.\" Dickie laughed at Rosa's sudden outburst of slang, but her touch on his arm was magnetic. He felt he could not refuse this pretty creature anything, so he leaned forward and told the chauffeur to drive still faster. Then the great car bounded forward like a creature possessed-a.. snorting maddened monster-a monster of steel and iron and wood. The Lill was taken splendidly. The car raced up wild:y, but something went wrong during the rapid, tearing, rushing descent. The chauffeur suddenly lost all ontrol over the blrakes, anld a team of horses drawIng some heavy tree-trunks could not get out of the way quick enough. The motor dashed straight into the timber waggon-crashlng into it with frightful violence - colliding--orerturning, and the fall of the great car was as the fall of a giant. Dickle Melton picked himself up after the smash. He was vaguely aware that he had been hurled right into the hedge and that his left arm hung he:plessly down by his sidealso that a cut on his forehead was bleeding profusely; but he was not thinking of his own injuries for the moment-he, was wondering what had happened to Rosa. He stumbled to the scene of the catastrophe. He felt faint and ill, and it was all he could do to get to where the - wrecked car - lay, for everything seemed to go :aroundthe earth-the sky, and blood dripped down his cheeks. He heard a confused babel of voices, and he saw that the men In charge of the timber waggon hadall gathered around the car and were trying to raise it, and they spoke in scared voices. No wonder-no wonder at all, for, pinned under the car there lay a butterfly-a crushed and broken butterfly who would never flash her wings in the sunshine again -a dead butterfly! CHAPTER XXV. '\"You poor girl-oh, poor Rosa!\" Rachel's voice was full of the most tender compassion. Her eyes were dim with tears and her hands trembled a little as-she arranged some white flowers: which she had just brought in from the garden around the bed on which Rosa lay sleeping her last sleep, for Dickle Melton had had Rosa's dead body conveyed to the Red House; but her entrance had been a very different entrance to the one Rosa had so eagerly anticipated. She had been carried on men's shoulders across the hall, a stiff and silent' little figure-no color in her cheeks---o color in her lips-her eyes closed for ever on the pomps and vanities of this world-her restless heart still. Rosa's body had'been removed to the Red House because Dickie felt it was only fitting that Rosa should lie in state in her own home-in the home she had never occupied.- It was what the girl would have wished herself, he thought-what she would have desired. \"Rachel was overwhelmed with compassion- when she learnt of the catastrophe, and now, as she stood in the death chamber gazing down at all that was left of Rosa Jennings, her tears flowed swiftly, for it seemed so terribly sad that such a tragic doom should have overtaken the young girl-that Rosa should have been cut down in the full flush of her beauty, just when she had got everything in the world, that she wanted. \"I do \"feel so sorry, dear-I do indeed.\"  Rachel stooped down and arranged some roses on the dead girl's breast -snowy white roses, and she placed a veil reverently over Rosa's face. Candles were standing on each side of the coffin-heavy wax candles, and Rosa's funeral had been fixed for the morrow. She was to be buried in the churchyard of the parish churchlaid to rest by the side of her' alleged father..The The door of the death chamber orened slowly, and Miss Carpenter tip-toed in. Her face wore a scared look, nor was'this much to be wondered' at, for the worthy gouvernante had received so many shocks duridg the last few days. She had no sooner recovered from the news of Rachel's loss of fortune than she had been called upon to congratulate the girl on her engagement to Debonair Harding; then there had been Rosa's tragic home-coming, so it was little wonder that Miss Carpenter felt very nervy and upset and looked ill and over-wrought, and her voice' sounded queer and shaky as she addressed Rachel.  \"My darling-an old woman is downstairs-a queer old woman who calls herself Gwen Owen, and it appears that she knew poor Rosa very well. She wants to speak to you for a few minutes and then to be allowed to come into this room and see-. her. She has brought some flowers.\" \"Poor old soul! I will go downstairs at once. Where has she been shown?\" \"They have shown her into the morning-room. I am afraid you have got a very distressing interview in front of you, Rachel The old woman seems dreadfully upset.\" \"I don't wonder,\" Rachel answered. She turned and looked at the r-otionless little .figure lying on the bed, then, after breathing a prayer for the welfare of Rosa's soul, she slipped noiselessly out of the death chamber and made her swift way downstairs to . the morning-rooiu, where she found Gwen Owen awaiting her. The first sight of old Gwen's face filled Rachel with the most intense pity. She read such misery in the old woman's eyes-such hopeless misery. \"Forgive me for making so bold as to come down here, miss,\" old Gwen began; She was deathly pale -almost livid, but there were no tears in her eyes; her anguish was beyond the relief of tears. It was only her will that seemed to hold her together-that gave her courage to stand up and face Rachel. \"Oh, I am so glad youi have come.\" Rachel spoke in very gentle tones. \"I can see that you loved poor Rosa -that you loved her dearly, and I feel that she ought to have those who loved her about her.\" .\"Yes, I loved -the lass. I loved Rosa better than'anything in this world. .I put her above my own immortal soul; but I feel that I am responsible for what has happenedthat it is owing to me that the lit' tle lass has come to an untimely end -indeed, an' I do.\" \"But why should you say such dreadful things?\" Rachel murmured gently. She tried to put Gwen into an armchair as she spoke, but the old woman stood up obstinately. \"Why do I say such things?\" Gwen cried hoarsely. \"Indeed, 'tis the truth, missie-the truth; for I have a confession to make to you. That Jead lass upstairs is my own niece-my youngest sister's nameless child. She is no kin to Mr. and Mrs. Sturm. 'Twas q wicked, cruel trick I played upon my master and mistress in the past-the master an' mistress sho trusted me so completely, for I subs stltuted Nanr's baby for their c~u?in's child-the actress woman's in fant. Yes, I took Violet Jenninig,' baby out of the cradle and I pult Nani's child in, and Nani took tne other babe with hier into W\\Vales and deserted the poor littlecreature-exposed it in a field, knowing well enough that she had slipped her own child into a warm nest and that I was tending it. Nani died a year or two later-died a miserable death in a fever hospital, an' maybe that was God's way of punishing her, an' now He's punishing me in my turnstriking at me through that which I loved-slaying the innocent for the guilty.\" She began\" to wring her hands feebly-to wail aloud after the manner of the Welsh women when they mourn their dead. Rachel looked at Gwen in dumb amaze. .Astonishment had literally taken her breath away. \"Good heavens!\" she gasped at last. \"What are you telling me? What are you saying?\" .\"I am telling you the truth,\" Gwen retorted fiercely. \"Rosa is my own niece and I have loved her as a daughter all my life-the pretty one -the darling lamb; not that she ever guessed or suspected the truth. She honestly .believed that she was Mr. Jordan's daughter; but 'tis ywn who are really his child; for the baby whom Rab Taylor found in his field-the infant whom he and his wife cherished and looked afterwhy, who was it but the child we stole from the 'tradle,' my sister and I?\" \"What' do you mean to tell me,\" Rachel interrupted, \"that Mr. Jordan adopted me, his own child, in total ignorance of the fact that I was his daughter? Oh, what an extraordinary-what an unheard-of thing has happened! What a marvellous thing!\" '\"The hand of the Lord was in itnever doubt that,\" Gwen answered solemnly. \"Jehovah -looked down from heaven and determined that justice should be done to the innocent -that a great wrong should be righted. That was why he put it into the hearts of Rab Taylor and' his wife to answer Mr. Jordan's advertisement when he advertised that he wanted to adopt a child, and it was on your account that my Rosa had to perish, for she was standing in your shoes. Innocently - ignorantly-she was taking that to which she had no right-the property to which she had I no claim, for you are Mr. Jordan's daughter-you!\" \"What! I am my father's daughter?\"  Rachel spoke in low, bewildered tones, for it would take her some time before she would be able to realise tne true position of affairs -grasp the amazing fact that she was really John Jordan's disowned child-the child of his first marriage, and so the legal as well as the moral heiress to his wealth. \"Yes, God help me, I am telling you the truth. You are your father's daughter,\" old Gw n repeated solemnly; then she covered her face with her hands. \"Take me to Rosa's bedside,\" she moaned. \"Let me kneel by my dead. Let' me mourn my dead.\" Rachel 'put a gentle arm around Gwen's heaving shoulders and led the old woman from the room-led her upstairs to that quiet, silent chamber where Rosa lay asleepRosa whose whole existence, though she knew it not, had been a lie, nameless Rosa.\"And \"And so Rachel turns out to be the heiress after all, and there's no question now, dear boy, of your having to.leave England after your marriage and try and make a living as a Canadian farmer. You will reside at the Red House with your wife till you' step into your father's shoestill Manor Court is yours.\" Mrs. Harding smiled as she spoke -a smile that lit up her small face, the face that had grown much sweeter during the last two or three week; then she looked at Debonair very earnestly, Debonair who was sitting with her in her own little boudoir-the room that would shortly be put into the hands of the painters and decorators, for Rachel had insisted that she should be allowed to restore Manor Court to its former splendor' as soon as she was married to Debonair. The land was to .be properly cultivated-the great estate .put into complete order. New cottages were to be built--new fences put up, for Manor Court was to hold up its head once more and become one of the great country seats of Kent. \"There's something I want to tell you, Debonair. There's something I' feel I must tell you.\" Mrs. Hard-' ing's lips trembled a little, then she bent forward in her hair. \"I should have wanted you to marry Rachel! even if she had not had a penny, for I have learnt my lesson, Debonairthe lesson that it has taken me over fifty years to learn. I realise now that no' marriage can be a really happy marriage unless\" the bride loves the bridegroom and the bridegroom loves the bride, and that money is after all only a means to an end; and I am so thankful nowoh, so thankful-that I wrote to you whilst we still thought Rachel a poor girl and advised you to break with .Rosa Jennings to marry your true love, forgetting for once in my life to be worldly-wise and ready to sacrifice Manor Court for you, Debonair -for your happiness.\" The door opened as Mrs. Harding said the last words, and Rachel entered the room unannounced. She had just walked over to Manor Court. She carried a big bunch of roses in her hands, and she looked like a rose nerself, for she was to be a bride in a week's time-the happiest bride in England.\" \"My darling-I didn't know you were-coming here this afternoon- or I would have walked over and met you.\" Debonair sprang from his chair and hurried up to Rachel, then he led her to the window. \"Listen,\" he cried. \"Do you hear the sound of hammering in the distance-far away across the fields? The ruined old cottages are being pulled down, Rachel-the cottages that you are going to build up. Listen to the hammers!\"  Rachel listened to the distant sound of hammering, and as she did so a smile played about her lipsa very happy smile, for she knew that she had come into Debonair's life not only to bring happiness to her husband, but to prove the salvation of his house. Mrs. Harding stole quietly from the room, leaving the lovers standing together by the window, and the sound of the distant hammering filled her with a curious joy-a joy almiost beyond expression, for, looking far ahead into the futur,, down the long vista of years, sh,, emed to see a rosy-cheeked pry, ion o1 children--children who w. \" carry on the name of Ilarding I thile .ird and fourthl general ard whose home would he at 'danor Court; and then certain lines from the Bible floated into her mind: \"Except the Lord build the house. they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.\" \"Yes, that's true-oh, that's true,\" Mrs. Harding murmured. \"But I feel that God will bless the union between Rachel and my son---I know He will-and, if so, His blessing will also rest upon their house-Gpd's blesting!\" The End.","wordCount":5645,"illustrated":false}

The wedding took place in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and the future Emperor of the Huns and Chief of the Baby Killers eat between the present beloved Duke of Con. naught and the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg, better known as the Duke of Edinburgh, mere boys at the time. During the ceremony Big Willie, who was then Little Willie, wouldn't sit still.

The centralisation of subh'l a large proportion of our 'popiiltion in the 'cities; and thesteady flow, to those centres from the count'ry, mnst seriously interfere w'ith primary production, and every effort should be made to reverse the undesirable condition of affairs by making country life more attractive and. congenial.

February month, probably because the preceeding iionth is very-dry, arid no rain falling,' is generally an anxious time for the caretaker of the reservoir in regulating the force to give householders their domestic supply. Up to the last few days the pressure has been very good, but there is now a noticeable decline, which is a sure indication there is very few feet of water in the reservoir. One thing stands out very dclearly that for a domestic supply there is ample, but when it comes to irrigating and gardening. and the hose going the whole day long, then it requires another reservoir of the same dimensions to meet the extra demand that is always made at this period of the year. It has been remarked by some that the town should be fed off the psain, and the reservoir kept in reserve as a standby for this time of the year, but its hardly likely this would make any difference. The capacity of the reservoir is altogether too small, and either wants widening or eitending so that it will hold a considerable greater supply. This is a matter for the Trust to thoroughly go into and to if possible make some provision for a contingency that will always crop tip at this time of the year. The induction of the Rev. J. Jackson to the charge of the Broadford Presbyterian Church took place on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of memb:rs of the church: The Interim-Moderator Rev.

Rev, Weber (Alexsndra) preached an' eloquent sermon on the foundation of the Christian church. Rev. Macdou,all (Seymnour] and Rev. G.

Brigadier-General E. Tivey Commander of the 10th Australian Infantry Brigade, has arrived in London from the Somme. Interviewed; he said:- \"1 am indcided to take off my bat whenever I see an Australian soldier. The men have shown marvellous endurance, patience and pluck during the terrible winter.

He bailed one of the honorary female attendants, and gave his order with the air of a man who was entertaining the Prince of Wales at the Ritz. He was hongry and became impatient. \"Hey, miss,\" lie bawled to one of the attendants, \"trot along that steak quick and lively-wake up,\" When he had fed, one of the lad's from another table joined him, and gave hii the- information that the attendant he'?ad shouted to was Lady Plumer, ,wife of the hero of Mafeking , \"I don't care who she is the wife of,\" was all the soldier said, \"I know she's a topping good waitress.\"  During the last week or two small outbreaks of fire along the Sydney road have occurred, due, it is thought to sparks fromi passing trains, and had it not been for the prompt action of the Misses I Sutton, there would probably have been extensive bush fires raging.: On two separate occasions; these youing ladies have been instriimental in extingtishing outbreaks when there was no men help available, and they=a;re' deserving of the thanks of landholders and townspeople for their prompt action.

The late Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, for years sought release from the appalling tragedies of his life in death. He was haunted by a terrible curse. \"May your life be wrecked and yet may you live on in lonely, unbroken and horrible grief, to tremble when you hear the name of Karolyl.\" It was Countess- Karolyi who uttered this awful imprecation when her husband fell a victim in the Austrian massacre of Hungarians. This fearful curse was uttered over sixty years ago, and from that day Fate marked the Austrian Emperor down for a life of tragedy and sorrow. At eightyfive, he awaited the end tremblingly, knowing \\that, terrible though the punishment had been, he had in a great measure deserved it. See how the curse of Countess Karolyi has worked. His brpther, Maximilian, who had attempted to. establish a Franco-Austrian monarchy in Mexico, was executed.  Carlotta, the 'wife of Maximilian, went insane as the result of her husband's execution.The The Emperor's only son, the Crown Prince Rudolph of Myerling, was found dead with Baroness Vetsera following a romantic love-affair. Stephanle, widow of the Crown Prince, married an attache of the Austrian Embassy, losing her Royal rank. Archduke Johann Salvatore fell in love with a dancer, and on being refused the right to marry her resigned his rank, married her despite the Royal decree, and sailed for America. He was lost at sea. Duchess d'Alencon, the Emperor's eister-in-law, was burned to death in a charity bazaar in Paris. Francis Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the throne, married beneath him, and the humbled Emperor had to acquiesce. - Empress 'Elizabeth, the Consort of Francis Joseph, was assassinated in Switzerland after an estrangement from the Emperor. And then came the crowning tragedy of all. In June, 1914, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, nephew of the Emperor and heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated in the streets of 'Sarajevo, Bosnia, a tragedy which precipitated this great war.","wordCount":358,"illustrated":false}

(By the Hon. and Rev. James Adderley, Hon. Canon of Birmingham Cathedral.) The physical pain of death depends, I suppose, on the particular cause of death, Naturally, death from starvation or cancer must be very much more painful than death from old age. Dying is probably more painful than death itself. At some most painful death-beds there seems to come a period of pity that for the sake of relations a death agony is sometimes prolonged by the use of powerful drugs. I remember a' doctor saying to me at the death-bed of a young officer, \"If there were -relatives here we should keep him alive a few hours.\" Why should a dying man be kept alive for these sentimental reasons?.I I suppose a great deal of the painfulness of death is due to our struggling against it. Just as when we resist an anaesthetic it causes us great discomfort, while if we meekly submit to it the sensation is delightful, so with death. The reason we resist is that we cling to life. This does not necessarily mean that we are afraid to die, or that we have doubts about immortality, and want to have as much of this world as possible for fear there is no other. The greatest struggle for life I ever witnessed was on the part of a young spiritualist, who most certainly believed in the next world. He simply refused to die, and did literally live some days longer because of his determination. It was rather splendid, this insistence on life, though it probably cost him a lot of pain. On the other hand, I remember a young soldier in France who died from sheer lack of wanting to live. The doctor told me that he need not have died if he had only resolved to live. Another case I remember of a young Tommy who had had a long, weary illness from an awful wound. He, no doubt, was bound to die, but he too lost heart. It was arranged that he should go to \"Blighty,\" but he had ceased to care to do so, and refused. The end came very rapidly after that. I think these instances show that much depends on will-power. My own father was a man of extraordinary vitality. A month before his death his doctor said to me, \"By all the laws he ought to be dead now.\" It was difficult to believe a few hours before his death, at the age of ninety, that he was a dying man. His again was a case of the most absolute belief in the other world, coupled with an intense desire to live and not die a moment too soon. Probably the greatest pain in death is mental pain. I can conceive a wasted life, a stupid life, and, still more, a wicked life making it very painful for a man to die. At the same time I am bound to say that many people who have lived a very unsatisfactory life are apparently able to make a very peaceful end. Perhaps they have never understood what life is, 'or what it is meant for. To lose it does not mean much for such persons. Others, I think, are really sorry to die, because they have been so much interested in life, and there are all sorts of problems they had hoped to see solved, and now it is all going to be hid from their sight. This is exactly where religion does bring great comfort to the dying. The man of faith has lived \"seeing the invisible,\" and now he is going to see it visibly. He has always been \"proving the unseen\"; now it will be seen. I think that religious teachers are foolish not to preach heaven as the solving of doubts-and thi enjoyment of truth. What the late Minor-Canon Shuttleworth used to call \"a -giant tea garden with a mammoth Crystal Palace in the background\" can never attract some people to heaven. Mr. Bradlaugh used to say that he did not want to go to heaven if none of the heretics of history were to be there. It is a far cry from such persons to the poor wounded Tummies, But there again I verily believe that peace does come to them on their death-beds from the thought of duty done on the one side and the prospect of seeing Christ on the other. I was in a hospital near the Front the other day. after \"the push.\" \"He was with me, I'm sure of it,\" was what more than one man said as he lay dying.","wordCount":797,"illustrated":false}

(All Rights Reserved.) CHAPTER I.","fulltext":"The Curate of Durnley By E. HULME BEAMAN, Author of \"To-morrow and a Bride.\" Published by Arrangement with Cassell and Co., Melbourne and Lon. (All Rights Reserved.) CHAPTER L By the Light of the Moon. The bar parlor of the Three Cranes, the principal house of call in the village of Durnley, was as usual well filled by its local patrons. Outside, the snow was falling in thin indeterminate flakes, the night was raw and chill; inside, a bright fire blazed on the wide hearth, diffusing a warm and pleasant glow around the lowroofed room.Half-a-dozen Half-a-dozen or so men were listening, with pipes in their mouths and eyes solemnly attentive, to the dfscourse of another of their numbera thin, angular-laborer, whose high, insistent voice quivered with a sense of importance as he pursued his narrative.  Its interest was beyond question, for it concerned two people of much local consequence-one, the Rev. Aubrey At wyl, Curate of Durnley; the other, Mr. Fred Burton, the young squire of the neighboring village of Barfield. The voice went on: \"And I heard 'im say: 'Damn yer! I'll be even with you yet, you saintly hypocrite!' Them was his very words, I can swear to it, 'cos I kep' on repeating of 'em to myself all the way 'ome so as to be dog-sure of getting 'em by heart.\" There was a slight silence of grave meditation after this statement, which was broken by a question. \"And what,\" asked one of the company, slowly removing his pipe from his lips and surveying the first speaker judicially-\"what did Muster Anwyl say to 'im?\" \"Mr. Anwyl he says quite cool and calm-like: 'Oh, I shall know 'ow to deal with you, Burton, when the time comes! Meanwhile, take my advice and keep out of my path, or I won't answer for the consequences!'\" \"Properly spoke!\" was the universal comment of the listeners. \"That's like Muster Anwyl, that is. A fine man and won't stand no nonsense from no one-not 'im!\" The incident of which these remarks formed the culmination, divested of prolixity and country dialect, seemed briefly to be this: Ben Robinson, a laborer who worked for a farmer on the outskirts of Durnley, was returning home at about half-past four that afternoon when, crossing a field that ran be-i side a lane leading from Barfield to Durnley, he heard two men talking rather loudly. He approached the hedge which divided the field from the lane, and could then distinguish quite plainly the words and voices of the speakers, both of whom were well known to him. The actual subject of dispute was not revealed, but that something had transpired between the two gentlemen of a provocative character was evident. For when Robinson got within earshot, the men were undoubtedly on the verge of a serious quarrel. Conjecture as to the cause of this quarrel-only, as it appeared, averted by a breaking twig-kept the imagination of the company pleasantly engaged for the rest of the evening. So far, however, as the villagers were concerned, the origin of the quarrel was never known, though the fact of it remained, and, indeed, became indelibly impressed on their memories by a subsequent event. Aubrey Anwyl had now been curate of Durnley for a little more than a year, and during that short time he had gained a large share of respects and popularity among his parishioners, not through the austerity of his manner or any ritualistic prejudices he may have exhibited, but from the innate manliness of his nature and an essential masculinity which characterised his dealings with his fellow-men.  At first his reserve rather alarmed and repelled the villagers, but when they got to know him better they found that this was merely a cloak for various sterling qualities which they were quick to perceive and appreciate. In fact, the curate's natural reserve fell away far more readily before his inferiors than his social equals; and many a countryman and countrywoman, too, in Durnley knew and understood the Rev. -Aubrey Anwyl better than his own rector, the Rev. Charles Thorndike, or his friends, the Escotts, of Durnley Manor, did. There was, perhaps, one exception, and that was Arminel Escott, the only daughter of Sir Alan Escott, Baronet, Justice of the Peace and Lord of the Manor. She was a very pretty girl of twenty, slim, graceful, with wavy chestnut hair over a low white brow, a straight little patrician nose, soft rounded chin, a mobile mouth not without character, and very beautiful eyes of - baffling blue. It took Aubrey Anwyl just two weeks to ascertain that he was in love with Arminel Escott, and just two minutes longer to make up his mind to marry her. But it took a year before he could win Arminel to his way of thinking; and only thenquite suddenly, after the manner of young girls-did she, on her side, make the startling discovery that she had been in love with him all the time. The curate's ambition, his personal force, his good birth (for he was connected with the Devonshire Anwyls), and the fact that he had a private income of nearly a thousand a year, had prevailed with Sir Alan Escott to give a somewhat reluctant consent to the engagement The baronet, in truth, had no great fancy for a clerical son-in-law; he had looked for one rather among the ranks of the landed gentry or the peerage; but there appeared no practical grounds on which to base an objection to the match, and he stlpulated only that it should not take place for six months. One of these had already passed by when Anwyl and Arminel were sauntering together one morning through the grounds of the Manor. It was the morning following the discussion in the bar parlor of the Three Cranes which has been mentioned; the air was clear and dry, the sun shone, and the lovers lingered arm in arm a few moments before moving forward to the house. Arminel, fragrant add dainty in her frs, clung to the eur-te,-looking up at him as they stood at the bend of one of the paths with a trustful adorations so provocative that the young man stooped suddenly and kissed her lips. Ho held her for a moment very close to him, almost crushing the girl's slim, soft body in his strong arms; and then, pushing her a little from him, held her so while he gazed down at her with a curious expression on his clean-cut, handsome face. \"Arminel,\" he said gravely, \"when one is very happy one begins to fear. Fortune, like the Greeks of old, is most to be distrusted when she lavishes on us her best and choicest gifts. My dearest, I am very happy just now-too happy.\" \"Why do you say that?\" she asked, wondering a little at his tone. \"It is not possible to be too happy.\" \"No, but it always seems impossible for too great happiness to last.\" He looked away over her head into the distance and sighed. \"Supposing,\" he went on after a brief pause, \"just supposing that something unexpected were to happen-the only certain thing, the 'unexpected'-something, let us assume, that should place me in an unfavorable light, would this affect your opinion of me, dearest-your belief in me, yourlove?\"  his eyes were turned on hers now, with a brooding, anxious look. But Arminel only laughed lightly. The idea of anything ever happening which could possibly change her feelings towards Aubrey- ! For there is no confidence so completely touching as the confidence in each other of two lovers. \"You dear silly boy!\" she chi-de him playfully. \"You know that nothIng in the world could make me believe anything bad of you-is it likely?\" She turned the thought over in her mind as she spoke, and found it ridiculous. \"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she added, almost resentfully. \"Why, you are my hostage to Fortune,\" he smiled now, \"and I fearI fear to lose you! A fancy has come upon m to-day, too--an odd fancy!that something might some day happen which-\" He broke off abruptly with a short laugh. \"But I am talking nonsense, pure nonsense. I don't as a rule give way -to superstitious moods, either. Between us, between you and me, dearest, nothing shall ever come! I keep that superstition at least in my heart-no, it is not a superstition-it is a belief, a conviction! And you share it, do you not?\" \"Yes,\" said Arminel, suddenly a little serious, in spite of herself, \"I feel that too-I know it, Aubrey. Nothing can ever now come between us-dear!\" \"Nothing!\" he repeated with emphasis, and as if to seal a compact, kissed her again on her smooth upturned brow.Just Just then, a young man, whistling, with a retriever at his heels, came Into sight. around the bend of the path, and, seeing the couple, nodded carelessly. \"Ah, here's your brother Dennis,\" observed Anwyl, in a lighter tone. \"Sometimes, do you know, I am inclined to be jealous of Master Dennis-you seem so absurdly, so unreasonably fond of the young man, Arminel!\" \"You need not be jealous,\" whis. pered the girl shyly. \"I am awfully fond of dear old Den, of course, but I-I love you best!\" Chance, with an ironic humor not infrequently noticeable in its operations, had set a tramp padding along the high road that leads from the village of Durnley to the adjacent Midland town of Carmington, on a clear winter's evening about two weeks later. The moon was up, there was a sharp ting of frost in the air, the sky was cloudless, the stretch of road before him deserted. It was about half-past eight, he judged; and, becoming sensible of a slight weariness, the tramp decided to rest for a few moments by the wayside, when, suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching him. They were rapid footsteps, ringing firm and strong on the hard road, the footsteps of a man evidently who, in a dozen more yards or so, would overtake him. Some native instinct of caution, combined with a disinclination for society, prompted the vagrant to seek hurried shelter; he slouched stealthily to the hedge, at the side of the road, and cowered down beneath its shadow. -No sooner had he done this than there came swinging past in the full light of the moon a man of fine stature. He wore a dark overcoat, the collar turned up about his ears, and a clerical hat, under the brim of which the tramp lurking in the hedge could distinguish the outline of strong, clear-cut features. His gait had the fearless ease and vigor of a trained athlete, he carried no stick, and his arms moved with the rhythmic precision of the practised walker. The tramp watched the man pass and turn the bend of the road a few yards further on, where it dipped into a gradual .hollow; then, growing conscious of the cold, he rose and prepared to continue his way, bhut again he shrank back, llstening-fdr voices had struck' upon his ear, men's voices raised apparently in anger. Almost the next ihistant another sound sent him cowering further back into the shadow-the shard, ald' gry report of a pistol shot. Something quite unusual in his experience, something possibly tragic, was happening in that hollow beyond the bend of the road; and the tramp,., under the spur of curiosity, crept stealthily forward. He moved like some predatory animal, padding furtively along the strip of grass that bordered the roadway, and when he gained the corner, stood rigid and watchful, his wary gaze fixed on the scene before him. In the moonlight it was revealed plainly enough in-all its patent significance. Scarcely a dozen yards from the tramp the figure of a man was bending over a prostrate body. The watcher recognised the man at once. It was the tall pedestrian who had passed him a short time ago, the man with the clerical hat . But the tramp's keen eyes, quick to observe details, had also marked something else--another factor in the scene of which he made a deflnite mental note. Then, still wary, he crept a little closer. How calm the night was, how bright the moon! In the face of an obvious tragedy there seemed to him something almost indecent in this brilliant light; it made him shudder, too, with an instinctive sense of in security-of complicity even in some secret crime. A stiange silence had fallen, and the impression of solitude became oddly accentuated by those two quiet forms, the one standing, the other lying in the path before him.... Then suddenly the man in the clerical hat stooped and, picking up a small object at his feet, drew himself erect, with a quick glance to right and left of him. The tramp shrank back against the hedge. . Not a sound could be heard, not another living creature was in sight. The man walked swiftly to the side of the road, peered an instant through a gap in the brambles, and-then, with a decisive' gesture, flung the pistol he held clear over the hedge. It fell with a dull splash into a small pond close on the other side. The man strode back to the recumbent body, and, lifting it carefully in his arms, carried it to the strip of turf at the edge of the road. A moment he stood looking down at it there, then swung on his heel and walked rapidly' on towards the village. The tramp shook himself, and with a muttered exclamation shuffled forward to the spot where the body lay, stark and motionless, in the sha. dow. Bending down, he felt with quick, deft fingers in the dead man's pockets. They contained some loose silver and copper coins, which the tramp, who was an opportunist, transferred to his own; but being at the same time gifted with extreme prudence he forebore to annex the victim's gold watch and chain, though sorely tempted to douso. Then, pulling his ragged coat more closely about him, he hurried silently after the man in the clerical hat. CHAPTER II. Found Dead. Sir Alan looked up, and his eyes softened as they rested with evident pride and affection on the graceful form and bright, pretty face of his favorite- child. \"I wonder,\" mused the girl, nestling down on a low stool by, her father's side, and leaning one arm lightly against his knee, while with the other she caressed the retriever's ear, \"what has become of Dennid?. He is very late, and he promised to bring back some books for me from Smith's. Perhaps he is staying the night at Carmington.\" The baronet nodded with small interest. His eye had suddenly been caught by the flash of a slender diamond ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, beautifully set with pearls and brilliants, which sparkled in the firelight, and for a moment his face clouded. \"Arminel, my dear,\" he said slowly, \"are you sure-quite sure-you have not made a mistake?\" \"A mistake?\" The girl's eyes lifted inquiringly, and noticing the direction of his glance dropped again, while a slow flush mounted to her cheeks. \"A mistake?\" she repeated, in a low tone. \"What do .you mean, dad?\" Sir. Alan touched the ring lightly with his finger. \"That!\" he answered. \"Are you sure that you love him well enough to marry him?\" \"I love him-Aubrey--better than anything in the world!\" she declared vehemently, but with her eyes still staring down into the fire. \"Why do you ask me such a question? What could possibly make you suppose that I-didn't?\" \"I have supposed nothing,\" smiled the baronet, a little sadly. \"But it is natural for a father to feel a little anxious. I could not bear to think that my little girl should find out afterwards-too late-that she had any reason to-well, to repent. I only wish to warn you. I only want you to-be careful!\" \"Warn me! What against?\" demanded the girl, hotly. \"Against marrying the best and noblest man in the world? Why, one would think,\" she went on petulantly, \"that you really had some reason for not wishing me to marry Aubrey!\" \"I have a reason-a very good reason,\" was Sir Alan's cool retort. \"I don't wish you to marry anyone. I don't want to lose you. We fathers are selfish old beggars.\" Arminel raised her eyes again and looked steadily at her father, and for a moment their glances held each other in silence, the baronet's grave, a little quizzical, the girl's unfaltering and defiant. \"That,\" she said, \"is not your real reason, dad. I have felt before somehow that-that you didn't altogether like Aubrey. And,\" she paused for the fraction of a second, \"I want to know why?\" The baronet hesitated a moment before answering, then he said, \"I will be quite candid with you, my dear child.. And I may say at once that if I had any reason to suspect that Anwyl was not all that you supposed him to be, I should never have sanctioned your engagement. It is not exactly that. Anwyl is in many respects a fine fellow, I grant you. He comes of a good stock, and is well off. So far as I know, his character is unimpeachable. But--\" again Sir Alan paused, as if at a loss precisely how to express his meaningwhich indeed he was, for he was anxious to avoid hurting the girl's feelings by uttering mere baseless prejudices. Arminel filled in the pause with a petulant exclamation.' \"Please tell me the triuth, father,\" she insisted. \"I want to know-I must know-why you dislike Aubrey?\"  \"I don't dislike him,\" said the baronet bluntly. \"But, since you drive me into a- corner, I must frankly admit that I've always felt with regard to Aubrey that there is something about him which I can't understand. I have formed the odd impression about Anwyl-and you must forgive plain speaking, since you have yourself demanded it--I have, I say, formed the impression that he is capable of being either a very good man or a very bad man-and for the life of me, I cannot determine which.\" \"Father!\" Arminel had started to her feet and stood before him with her little hands clenched and her eyes blazing. \"How dare you--how dare you suggest, or even hint, that Aubrey is a very bad man? Oh, you are ungenerous, and heartless, and unjust!\" \"Come, come!\" expostulated the baronet good-humoredly. \"I hope I'm neither the one nor the other, you little fury! You have forced me to express an opinion on a delicate matter, and I merely say that Annwyl puzzles me. He is an enigma, and 1 do not like enigmas. Shall we change the subject?\" \"No,\" exclaimed Arminel hotly, \"We- \" But her sentence was cut short by the abrupt opening of the door and the entrance of a young man, who strode unceremoniously into the room with a half-finished cigar in his mouth. \"Hello, dad. Hello, Arminel. Not gone to bed, yet, then? By the way, I'm awfully sorry, old girl, but I've clean forgotten about those books of yours. I'll get them to-morrow.\" He crossed to a tray on the sideboard and poured himself out a glass of whiskey from one of the decanters, tossing it off at a gulp. Sir Alan eyed the newcomer a little sternly.\"I \"I shouldn't drink too much of that stuff, Dennis,\" he cautioned. \"You are rather late. I suppose you have dined?\" \"Oh, yes, thanks. Had some dinner with Ferris at Carmington before seeing him off to town-that's what delayed -me. I had to wait for the nine-thirty back,\" replied Dennis Escott carelessly, and flinging the stump of his cigar into the grate, selected a fresh one from a silver box close by. \"Mother gone to bed, I suppose? I say, Amy, I feel I could do with a sandwich or something.\" The speaker was rather a strikinglooking man of twenty-five or so, the only survivng son of Sr Alan, and the heir to the baronetcy. After spending a few years in Canada, whither his father had despatched him ostensibly to learn practical farming, but actually to satisfy the boy's craving for adventure and keep him out of mischief, Dennis Escott had now returned home and taken up his residence at the Manor. He had well-cut features, a tanned complexion, a good figure, and a careless, swaggering air. A heavy dark moustache hid a weak mouth. He had black, restless eyes, which narrowed on the least provocation; in short, a handsome, rather bad-tempered face, lit at times by a singularly engaging smile. \"The servants are still up,\" said Arminel, rising. \"I'll go and order something for you, Denny, if you're hungry.\" \"No, no; don't bother,\" replied her brother, with a sudden \"change of mind. \"I'm not hungry.\" Sir Alan glanced at him and sat up. \"You look a bit fagged, though,\" he commented. \"Feel seedy?\" \"Not a bit, sir, thanks. Too much champagne at dinner, probably, and rotten bad champagne, too. Ferrers would have it. Any news, sir? No, really, Arminel, I want nothing.\" Arminel paused half-way to the door. \"You had better take a sandwich, Den!\" she coaxed him gently. \"You really do look tired out, and But before she could finish the sentence there was a sudden knock at the door, and, in answer to the baronet's \"Come in,\" one of the servants entered- the room with rather a scared face. He glanced from his master to Arminel, then back again at Sir Alan, and cleared his throat nervously. \"Well, what. is it? What is it?\" demanded the baronet curtly. \"Don't stand there staring like a wooden image!\"  \"Please, Sir Alan,\" replied the footman apologetically, \"there's someone wants to see you.\" \"To see me-at this time of night? I can't see anyone now. You ought to have sense enough to know that. Send him away. Stay-who is it?\" \"Well, Sir Alan\"-the man coughed awkwardly-\"it's a policeman.\" \"A policeman?\" The baronet gazed at the servant sharply. \"Yes, sir. One of the county police. He wishes to speak to you a moment.\" \"Show him in,\" commanded Sir Alan abruptly. \"Yes, yes, in here, man!\" as the servant hesitated. \"It's probably only some poaching matter or other.\" he added, as the man slipped noiselessly from the room. \"The rascals have been very busy lately.\" \"What the devil do they want to worry us about it now for?\" growled Dennis, irritably. \"Surely the matter could have waited till the morning, confound them.\" \"I'd better go,\" observed Arminel, preparing to move to the door, but her way was barred by the sudden appearance on the threshold of a burly form. Arminel stepped back to her father's. chair. \"Ah, Wilkins,\" called the baronet, addressing the policeman, whose name he knew, \"that you? Well, what's your business? Come in, man. What has happened?\" The constable .let his gaze drift stolidly to the girl, mentally decided that her presence there was no concern of his, and turned to the bar. onet. \"I have to lay an information, your worship, against some person or persons at present unknown,\" he began in a slow, phlegmatic \"voice. \"The body of a man has just been found shot dead on the high road about two miles from here--\" \"The body of a man, shot dead?\" ejaculated the baronet, with a swift change of tone and manner. \"Yes, your worship, and--\" \"Do you know who it is?\" interrupted Sir Alan sharply. \"Y'Tes, your worship. The body has been identified.\" . \"Well, well, who is it?\" The constable paused, cleared his throat, and for an instant appeared to hesitate. Then-\"It's eI Mr. Fred Burtoi, Sir Alan,\" he said slowly. There was a little gasping cry from Arminel; the color forsook her cheeks as she clutched at the back of a chair, gazing with wide, terrified eyes at the policeman. But Dennis had leapt to his feet and stood staring at the oficer. \"Fred Burton?\" he exclaimed. \"Fred Burton-dead? Good God!\" (To be Continued.) A certain worthy bishop was very fond of a quiet smoke, and he did not think that the habit was out of keeping with his high ofsfice. The archdeacon of the diocese, however, thought differently, and did not hesltate to proclaim his opinion. On one occasion the archdeacon was the guest of the bishop, and preached at the cathedral evening service. Having returned to the episcopal palace, he was gazing from the library windonw when he detected the bishop walking in the garden below, smoking a cigar, as he thought, in safe privacy. \"Ah, bishop.\" said the archdeacon, as he opened the window, \"so I have caught you burning incense to the devil!\" \"Perhaps you have,\" retorted the bishop; \"but I didn't know he was so near,\"","wordCount":4287,"illustrated":false}

Very few white people are keen about the Pier buot a low grade of dark skins are in galore. One can hnardly imagillne the appearance of them-they are only half dressed and what clothes they have got are so dirty and worn out that even the worst of our race wouldburnthem. Many fights were caused by thrpwing overboard loaves of bread and one man thinking hoehad a right to it, -whilst another tholight he oeght to have -it. However these are the objects who coal our Liner. All men are in'.Khaki and- are anxioius to go ashore-hbt up-runs the yellow flag.. We are qearintided A lairk shadow has passed over ill. However the citisions of COspe Town lhsve arranged to enter' taim us. _After some- time it is decided that no individnal leave will be granted, but tl'at the troops will mareb to the entertainment and straight back to the beot. As we march -through that ,dark Afaican town countlaes responsibilities rattle throughl our minds.; Many of us for the first time in a forein landZ-exposedto all temptation, cdmforted by the knowledge that nobody here knows us, -we are never likely te be here again e . But Conscisice's has to be obeyed. It queries us. flow wrould you act in Victoria? What is !the meaning of thle Khski -you wear? Wbat do those nine letters on your shoulder strap represent? Would you help to blight the fair name of the land of lyour birth ind so msr- the glorious reputatiod set up by th'se of your brothern who have bled and died on the bloody fields -of Gallipoli and Jrranes? The individual responasis on! emplastically, No I so on we imoareh notil-at last we ieaoh the HilU .where- Thg -yrious Patriotio eaocietiEsof Afrie entertain.n us. As we file into tite huge biilding, for it certainly is tinge, we r:ceive cheets and \"Good Louck Australia\" from the Hoats. During the evening a program is provided by the best talent of.the Town and- afterwards tea snd nks ins served. The ladies were very nice and occasiouly one would Ihear the name of a .Victorian town from their lips. Cune of the ladies to \\whom I was speali p kindly volunteered to write a note Ihone for me as in nil ptnobahility it weold catch the first mail from Africa whilst a letter from me would have to be censored.Whethcr this was done or not you will know tefore me. Time flies and we are Rain . moving' back to the boat after having spest-a very enjoyable veneing-but nevertheless what is wanted is \"ILenve'. A spark of dliscontentment i i noticet. The following morning; Tuesday, we go for a - route. march . and are to he entertained at sports- on the S, A. Oval in thin- afternoon. The men now are beginning to get desperate to get aff, with the -result that during the afternoon tlhe opportuanity is too great and hundrede \"break leave.' -Oni Wednesday we were again taken for a rente msrchi, but at the first halt everybody dismissed themselves and thus relieved the Officer's who by the way were also keen for \"Leave\", tltemselves. In a few minutee the town, and especially trams, cabs, \\\\as one swarming mtas of Khaki. They wvere out for sight eeing and having perhaps a little too much reserve vitality stored during three weeks exile, did not in all cases adopt the ordinary patsenger position, preferring to ride on the top of aebs and tramins. However this energy like their money soon vanished and they became deeply interested in learning something of the Southern. City. My first impression of town seas very ftavourable--but nevertheless I think the colored people would bore me. The buildings on the whole are splendid, especially the Public ones. The streets are wide, and roads in and about Town are 1 :fect. After dinner 1 took the special tram for Soldiers, to Cdmps Bay and was staggered by the beauty of the trip. the Electric tram first follows the main sea-side street giving one an opportunity of seeing the suburban I buildings which by.the way are noticeable for their red roofs and light colored painting. Then winding away we creep slowly up the side of the. Lions Head. After reaching a great attitude a beautiful view is witnessed. Immediately below is a perfect r.ad aloig which motors race at anything up to 60 miles per hour, and again below is the Ocean. -Much of this class of climbing and turning around the cliffs is done until the favourite watering place is reached. . Here all men wearing the Commonwealth uniform are treated to refreshments. After having the best cup of tea since I left Australia. I again boarded the tram, and returned by another route via the Lions Head. This part of the trip was equally interesting but of sather a different character-presenting more of the mountains aspect.. Along the mountains side could be seen growing the Silver. Tree in its land. How the sight of it made my mind travel back to Broadford and the nursery. Perhaps the most beautiful portion of the trip was the steep descent through the Pine Avenue as we again approach the Town. Unfortunately my eyes are not well trained to observe 'Natures Beauty' but I must confess this last scene, appealed to me, easily eclipsing anything of the kind I have ever seen. Down we speed-all too hurriedly, and again we find ourselves in the city once more. The fire station is now visited and the Motor fire fighting machines inspected. --' i.By this time the \"inner man\" talks, so we retire for tea.-selecting the Station Resturant. The meal was very good and niutich appreciated after ships rations. Aftertea a stroll through the streets and a visit to a Picture Th:atre brought aninteresting dayto a close. By the way I might here' say hotels are closed to soldiers and the sale of alcohilc drinks to them is a criminal offence. At 11.15 p.m. we all assemble and march back to the boat where we are to be again caged (for three weeks, for the 'Black tribe' have finished their work.) We are due to sail tomorrow (Thursday) at 5 o'clock. At 4 o'clock the enginesbegin to throb and we move out and anchor in the Harbour for about an hour whilst . \"stragglers\" who have not returned to the boat are brought aboarid by motor launches. At a few ihinates past five o'clock the anchor is lifted and Cape Town and its wonderful Mount gradually vanished. To our great surprise on the morrow we realize we ha've become a Battleship capable of leaving a nasty sting. Over our stern points a 4:7 inch gun ever wraiting-ever watching.

P'hyllis was trembling as she rose without a word and took his arm, and Jenkins swore audibly as Hector led her away. \"That man is a cad and a bully, Mliss Cramer,\" said Hector quietly, pausing at the door of the conservatory to sllow Phyllis time to recover bceore entering the ballroom. 'You would be well-advised to avoid hum.\" Sccs, I know,\" breathed Phyllis, her face chalk-white and her eyes :nil dark with dread. \"Hle frightens 180, nat\" sie deserves horse-whipping,\" inIw'8n-d hector, with a note of un.seti anger in his voice. \"I shall be glad if you will allow me to deal with the blackguard.\" \"No, no! Please, Lieutenant H-lampden, please don't interfere with him!\" gasped Phyllis. \"You-you will only make matters worse. You don't understand.\" She was about to explain, but suddenly changed her mind and broke off abruptly, biting her lip. \"I -1 will explain some other time,\" she added, in altered tones. \"Please excuse me now. I feel faint and tired, and will ask my mother to take me home. I am glad you came in just now, and I-I hope we shall meet again. Good-night, Lieutenant Hampden, and-thank you.\" She held out her slim white hand, which trembled as Hector clasped it, forced a smile, and hastened away, leaving the young officer feeling perplexed and disappointed. Hector stood still for a few minutes lost in thought, and was just about to reenter the ballroom when he heard a hasty step behind him, and Captain Jeunkins caught him by the arm and swung him around. \"What do you mean by.interfering with my affairs?\" he demanded savagely, his thin, sallow face contorted with passion. \"Hlow dare you address me as you did and take that girl away?\" Hector's first impulse was to smash his list into the fellow's dark face, but he managed to curb his passion. \"May 1 ask, you bully, what claim you have on Miss Cramer?\" he asked sternly. \"How dare you frighten and threaten the lady? Why, you miserable cad, you are not fit to mix with decent men and women, and it would serve you right if I-\" \"To the deuce with you, you Insolent young ass!\" burst out Jenkius furiously. \"The woman is my wife, and I shall talk to her as 1 like! She belongs to me, and is no better than she should be, and-\" Something seemed suddenly to snap in s-sector's head; his list shot out, straight front the shoulder, and Jenkins went down like a felled bullock, sprawling on his back In a bank of ferns and flowers at the entrance to the conservatory. For a few minutes he lay stunned, foaming with passion; but Hector's mad anger had died as quickly as it had flamed to life, and he realised that this was no place in which to administer chastisement to any scoundrel, however heinous the ollence. Several couples had started up from their seats and were gazing curiously at the two mlen. \"By heavens! you shall pay for that blow!\" snarled Jenkins, his hand on liis mouth, trom which blood was trickling, his basilisk eyes blasing.  'i am at your service at any time,\" retorted Hector calmly but incisively. \"'ou know who 1 ant and where to find me, and I shall . be only too pleased to have an opportunity of rllidig society of you.\" Hie turned on his heel and walked awiay abruptly, leaving Jenkins muttering and glaring balefully as he pressed his handkerchief to his swollen lips.\"I \"I suppose I am a fool!\" said Hector alouo an hour later, dropping wearily into an arm-chair. He had lost all taste for dancing after the departure of Phyllis and his encounter with Jenitms, aid had slipped aivay unnoticed from Dartmoor House and walked hone with his brain in a turmoil. He was quite alone In his chambers, therefore he could speak his thoughts aloud. \"Yes, a fool-a daft fool!\" he continued, apostrophising the fireplace. \"1 have fallen madly in love with a girl 1 have seen only twice and about whom I know practically nothing. I have made something of a scene in the Duchess of Dartmoor's house, and knocked a man down because he made an insulting remark about the girl and said she was his wife. Well, I am not sorry I koocked the blackguard down, and I am su-e he was lylng, but I suppose 1 am a fool nevertheless. 'The girl has bewitched me, and I feel that 1 would do the maddest things to serve her-and to win her.\" For a long time he sat still in his quiet room, thihking and dreaming, pulling at his well-worn briar. His reverie was disturhed at length by tub sound of loud voices from the flat below, occupied by Captain Cosmo Jenkins, cnd for some minutes Hentor sat listening to the noise and smiling grimly. He could not, of course, distinguish anything that was being said, but he judged by the loud toies of the voices \"iat a quarrel was in progress. \"Jenklus is in trouble to-night!\" he .muttered. \"Someone else is having a row with him now. Hullo! What was that!\" no sprang suddenly to his feet, for a dull report, sounding like the exploslon of a firearm, had' startled him. At the same moment the sound of quarreljlng ceased, abruptly. \"Sounded like.a pistol-shot,\" growled Hector, after standing listening for a few moments, \"but I suppose It mulst have been a motor tyre burst in the street. Queer!\" He went to the outer door and list. ened, but no one seemed to be stir. ring in the building, so he went back to his seat by the fireside, dismissing the iocident from lis mind. \"I suppose I had better lock tip and turn in,\" he murmiured, a few minutes later, rising and stretching himself wearily.He He knocked the. ashes front his pipe, and even as he made his way to tigh'hall dcor againhe was. brought Ito a standstill by the sound of a scream. He uttered an exclamation, istened intently for a moment, then threw- open the front door and leant secr the banister, It was undoubtediy a woimah who had screamed, and' the voice had come from Cosmo Jenkins' chanibers. \"Niw what the dickens should a follow do under the 'circumstances?\" grumbled Helctor, staring down at Jenkins' door, which was standing ajar. \"I can't very well interfere again. Alh! Hero's the. woman! Good heavens!\" -lte drew back suddenly, white to the very lips, and breathing unsteadily, for the woman who had rushed out of Jenklins' chambers and was now descending the stairs had glanced hack aitrightedly at that moment, and he had recognised her as -nvllls Cramer! Dazed and dumbtounded by his discovery, he stepped back into his own doorway and stood like a man stricken. Phyllis Cramer in Jenkins' chambers at that hour! Had the fellow been telling the truth after all? * \"I must find out!\" he said aloud, putting his hand up to his head. \"I .nust 'get to the bottom of this. I .ant the truth, and I mean to have it!\" His teeth came together with a snap, and without further hesitation io ran downstairs. The door of Jenkins' flat was still open, and Hector walked idto the hall without' ceremony.  \"Jenkins!\" he called out, but there was no response. \"Jenkins! I say, Jenkins!\" he cried again in perempLtory tones; but still there was no answer.  '-With an exclamation of impatience, dector flung open the door. of the .itting-room and entered, only to come to a. halt instantly, the color b!eaching out of his face and his eyes widening in horror and amazement. For Captain Cosmo Jenkins lay on' tht floor just within the room, and he had been shot through the head! CHAPTER III. \"Find the Woman.\" I Hector Hlampden felt as if he were living a nightmare as he stood staring with dilated eyes at the body at his feet. There could be no doubt that Jenkins was dead. The ghastly, greyisi-white face, the glassy eyes, and, above all, the bluish hole in the centre of the forehead and the dark pool of blood on the carpet, spoke' eloquently, if silently, of death-of' death that had come swiftly, instantaneously-from murder.\"Murdered!\" \"Murdered!\" breathed Hector, moistening his dry, still lips and Shuddering involuntarily as he said the ugly word. \"Murdered,\" he repeated dully, still staring as if fanscinated at the ghastly face of the dead man. A clock on the mantelshelf chimed one, and the sound made him start. He jerked himself upright, shaking off the inertia of horror that had gripped him, and the blood came back to his head with a rush. What was to be done? He flashed a glance around the brightly-lighted room, darted another look at the body, and stepped back into the hall, closing the door of the sitting-room, as if to shut out the ghastly thing from his sight. His brain was acting at lightning' speed now, and the significance of the events of the evening came back to him with full force. He had seen Jenkins threatening Phyllis and had intervened, he had heard the sound of quarrelling in Jenkins' chambers, heard a shot, heard a woman scream, and had seen Phyllis fly, obviylously terror-stricken, from Jenkin'b'.rooms. And now he hid found Jenkins shot through the head-murdered! Why had the girl come here at such an hour unless-unless-horrible as was the thought-w'hat Jenkins had said about her was true? What did it all mean? Hector stifled a groan and clenched his teeth and hands in the intensity of his feelings. -\"God help me!\" he muttered, hoarsely. \"What must I do? Everything seems to indicate that the girl murdered him, yet-yet-oh, hang it! I ca-'t denounce her. There must be some explanation. of her presence here. I don't believe she-\" He paused as a new 'thought struck him, and turned back to the sitting-room. \"Perhaps it is a case of suicide, and Jenkins by some fiendish trick induced her to come here.\" Conquering his aversion, he examined the body and searched the floor, but he found that Jenkins' hands were tightly clenc' ed, and there was no trace of a weapon, therefore the theory of suicide had to be dismissed.  Hector went out again and stood on the landing, the prey of a dozen conflicting emotions, unable to decide upon a course of action. \"Well, I can't leave.him here, and do nothing,\" he said alouid at last; \"that would be callous. I suppose there is nothing for it but to summon tihe police.\" ' -He ascended the stairs to his own rooms, stood frowning and undecided for a moment longer, then took up the telephone directory, tossing. it aside when he had found the number he waanted, amid seated himself with a sigh at the table on which the telephone stood, completely .master of Oimself once more. \"Hullo! Is that Scotland Yard? I arm Lieutenant Hampden, 99 Albany Chambers, St. James' street. Send someone here at once. There .has been a niurder committed in the flat. below mine.\" 'The man at the other end uttered an exclamation, and bade Hector hold the line and he would' put him 'through to the Criminal In-. vestigation Department, which he did at once. It was evilently someone in authority wiho answered now, and Hector repeated what he had said and answered the, questions put to him. ' \"I heard the sounds of quarrelling, then a shot-at least, at first I thought It was a motor tyre had burst in the street, bu;t I know now it must have been a shot. I heard a woman scream a few minutes later,1 and went out to the landing just in time to see a womitan run down the stairs. .'. No, I don't think I could' recogniso her. .. . I went down to Jenkins' rooms-yes, I knew the man slightly-Captain . Cosmo Jenkins, Dragoon Guards. .. Yes, the door wat open and I found him lying dead. Yes, I ant sure he is dead. . . .

You will send at once. . .' Yes. No. 'i, Lieutenant Hsmpden. . IIe hung up the ro:'i ver, ran down-1 stairs and oit into the street, And explained matteas to an astqishBed policeman whom he found only a few yards away from the doorway. The policeman produced his notebook, started off to call a doctor, then suddenly changed hfis mhind aneblew his whistle. \"What's the Idea?\" asked Hector In. surprise. \"Do you want to rouse the neighborhood, or do you need assistance to find a doctor?\" \"No, sir,\" said the constable promptly, but respectfully; \"but how do I know what you have said is right? I'll come back with you,-and my mate can go for the doctor.\" flector smiled grimly and shrugged his shoulders as the man glanced at him somewhat suspiciously, before turning to explain matters ponderoully to another constable, who had come up at the double. \"Come along and assure yourself that I am not boaxing you,\" he, said somewhat Irritably, for his nerves were on edge for all his outward calm. liHo led the way back to Jenkins' chanibers, and watched the policeman half-contemptuously, as he stared in horrified silence at the murdered man and tumbled helplessly with his notebook.  \"I expect someone will be here presently from the Yard, sir,\" the policeman remarked after asking one or two aimless questions, and even as he spoke, ilector heard the sound of hurrying footsteps on the staircase, and a few moments later a keen-looking, middle-aged man entered quickly, followed by an inspector in uniform.  \"Lieutenant Hampden?\" inquired the newcomer, as the constable saluted, and Hector nodded. \"I am Detective-Inspector Hazlett,\" continued the officer, and turned at once to examine the body of Jenkins. \"H'm! No doubt about his being dead or about it being murder,\" he commented grimly, glancing up after a close scrutiny. 'The doctor hasn't been in yet, I suppose? No. Well, he can't do anything excelt tell us how long the man has been dead.\" Ie straightened him-' se~f, eyeing Hector keenly but politely. \"How long is it since you heard the shot fired, sir?\" he asked quietly.  \"I should say about ten minutes or I a quarter of an hour before I rang I you up,\" answered Hector without hesitation. \"Might I ask why you waited - so long before giving the alarm?\" \"I thought I explained over the telephone that I did not come down until I heard the -woman scream and saw her, rush downstairs,\" answered Hector quietly. \"But surely the woman screamed as soon as the shot was fired?\" \"No, there was an interval of some minutes-five or ten minutes, I should say. The sound of the explosion startled me, as I have already explained, but as I heard no one stirring I concluded that the noise was caused by the bursting of a motorcar tyre.\"\"Queer!\" \"Queer!\" he commented. \"Don't imagine, sir, that I am trying to cast doubt on your statement; but it is strange that the woman should have kept silence for ten minutes after the shooting, and then screamed-eh? What was the woman like?\" \"I have no idea,\" Hector answered sharply. lie had decided that at least he would give the police no inkling as to the identity of the woman. \"I only caught a momentary glimpse of her as she rushed downstairs. I saw the figure was that of a woman, that I all\" \"Had you been in your chambers all the evening?\" \"No; only for perhaps an hour before I heard the disturbance. I was at the Duchess of Dartmoor's ball.\" \"You have no idea, I suppose, whether Captain Jenkins-that is his Iname, is it not?-was here when you came home? Is he a friend of yours?\" \"No; I merely knew him casually. I know he could not have been here when I arrived, as I left him at Dartmoor House. He was at the ball.\" \"Ah, indeed! That information should help us,\" said the detective. 'ile doctor, accompanicd by a con- .. u - at that moment, and there was silence while he made his examination. \"Been dead about half-an-hour or so,\" he announced, rising to his feet. \"Ugh! Murder, isn't it?\" \"Yes, doctor,\" said Detective Hazlett, and asked a few questions. The doctor turned to go, when suddenly a big man, clad only in shirt and trousers, and looking as it he had been roused hastily from sleep, appeared in the doorway. \"Here! What's all this?\" he demanded angrily. \"Who are you? Hlow did you get in? What's up?\" He caught sight of the corpse of Jenkins as he spoke, and jumped in alarm.\" \"Good lor'!\" he ejaculated, with a gasp of terror. \"Here--!\" \"Who are yout The hall-porter, I suppose?'t demanded the inspector sternly. \"Yes, I'm the hall-porter,\" responded the man, after staring for a moiment. \"How did you get in?\" \"I want you, my man!\" said the detective. \"When did you admit Captain Jenkine to-night?\" -\"I didn't admit him. He has a key -all the tenants have keys,\" answered the man, looking flustered and frightened. \"Has he. killed himself?\" \"Did you let a woman in about half-an-hour ago?\" inqulred the detective, ignoring the question. \"No; I've been in bed for-the last two hours, and anybody that came in must have had a key,\" replied the hall-porter. -\"Unless one of the tenants left the door open, eh?\" \"Excuse me, sir,\" interposed the constable who had brought the doctor. \"I saw a lady and gentleman come in here about an hour ago. I was %tanding at the corner, and saw the gentleman open the outside door with his latchkey.\" \"Ahl! Do you know if that was the man you saw, constable?\" asked the detective eagerly, pointing to the body. \"No, sir, I couldn't say for certain, but it looks something like him. You see, sir, I was at the corner, not close I enough to see him plainly, and he had his overcoat collar turned up.\" \"'Thank you; you may go now,\" said Inspector Hazlett, after asking a few more questions, and the constables saluted and tramped out. \"Did Captain Jenkins have a servant -here?\" asked the detective, turning to the hallporter again. \"No, sir,\" answered the man. \"He didn't stay here for long--only when he was in town. His regiment was stationed at Aldershot, and he only stopped hero occasionally. I tidy up his rooms and lok after things.\" - \"I see,\" said the detective with a nod. \"Very good; you can go now. I may want you again later.\" The hall-porter hesitated, scratched his head, then sighed lugubriously and took his departure. Inspector Hazlett stood still .for a few moments, frowning deeply, then once more he examined the body carefully and made a tour of the sitting-room, as if in search of something. Finally he seated himself on a corner of the table and looked! quizzically from Hector to the man in uniform. \"Well, sir, what do you make of it?\" queried Hector, calmly preparing to light a cigarette. \"I don't think it should take us long to find the culprit, Lieutenant Stampden,\" responded Inspector Hazlett. \"We know that Captain Jenkins was at Dartmoor House when you left, and that he arrived here in company with a woman about an hour ago. You heard a shot fired and saw a woman rush out. Of course, difficultfes which I do not anticipate may turn up; but it seems to me that it should not be very hard to discover at what time Captain Jenkins came away from the Duchess of Dartmoor's house, and whether he was alone. Possibly the woman-may have been at the ball-\" '\"I should hardly think so!\" interrupted Hector hastily. \"Or he may have met after leaving,\" proceeded the detective, taking no notice of the interruption. \"We can make inquiries at Dartmoor House and find that out, and we can find out it a woman took a cab near here half-an-hour or so ago, and where she drove to. The great thing is to find the woman. And I had better start at once. I suppose you will be here in the morning, sir?\" \"Yes; I am engaged at the Admiralty at present, and will be staying in town for a week or two,\" answered Hector. \"Good-night!\" He went up to his chambers and sat down heavily, feeling suddenly' faint and exhausted. The information that the constable had volunteered had staggered him, for it had never, occurred to him that Phyllis could have accompanied Jenkins from Dartmoor House. He realised instantly that if this were the case, the police would have no difficulty in establishing the identity of the woman. \"1 can't believe it!\" he muttered, sick at heart, and started to his feet as a new idea struck him. When the police made inquiries at Dartmoor House they would probably discover that he had quarrelled violently with Jenkins before leaving, and would doubtless suspect him of complicity in the murder! CHAPTER IV. The Eavesdropper. \"Delighted, Lieutenant Hampden,\" murmured .:lrs. Cramer, extending her hand. \"So good of you to call. Ics, thank you, I am quite well. Late hours seem to have no effect upon me whatever; indeed, I think 1 can stand them better than some bf you younger people. Phyllis, for instance, had to leave quite early last nigut, suudenly prostrated by a vioseut neadache.\"sectr sectr smiled politely as he turned to Phyllis, who was standing very erect, regarding him with strange intentness. lie had not retired until day was breaking and had slept but little, but save that he was just a trille haggard and his eyes were less oright tnan usual, he showed no sign of the strain he had endured. Duty had called .him to the Admiralty in the morning, but immediately after lunch he had driven to Lancaster Gate, ostensibly to call on Mrs. Cramer, in reality to endeavor to have a lew words with Phyllis alone. \"I hope you have quite recovered now, Miss Cramer?\" he said quietly, as he met Phyllis' eyes. \"It was a dreadful crush, wasn't it? I have a headache myself this morning.\" \"1 am much better now, thank you, Lieutenant Hampden,\" responded Phyllis, forcing a smile. \"I shall be all right by to-morrow. The-the excitement doesn't agree with me.\" lier lovely face was quite white save for a little patch of hectic color on either cheek, her violet eyes seemed almost black, and there were faint dark circles beneath them. Knowing what he did, Hector could imagine what a night of sleepless terror she had spent, and he marvelled now at her seeming calmness, forgetting-or not knowing-that a woman can smile while her heart is breaking and her mind is in purgatory. \"WVon't you sit down, Lieutenant Hampden?\" asked Mrs. Cramer, who shrewdly surmised that it was something stronger than mere courtesy that had brought Hector to the house thus early in the afternoon. She had not forgotten that Phyllis had started vi lently when the young man was announced, and she was more than curious. \"Phyllis gave us such a fright last night,\" she continued, with a smile, as Hector seated himself. \"She felt so unwell that she slipped out and came home alone, and when ir. Cramer and I were preparing to leave, of course she was, nowhere to be found. We thought she had been abducted--\" \"It is too bad of you, mother!\" interrupted Phyllis, blushing painfully. \"I told one of the footmen to explain that *was unwell and had gone home, and the stupid man must have for. gotten. I did not want to worry you, and you might ihave known that I should be all right, and that you vomild find me at home when you arrived.\"  \"I was only teasing, my dear,\" said Sirs. Cramer, with a laugh. \"As a matter of fact, the footman delivered your message just as I began to search for you.\" 'She was smiling as she turned to Hector again, and she 0 ticed instantly, without appearing to notice, that his tanned face had turned a shade paler and his firm lips had tightened. Was it poissible, she wondered, that this young naval officer had had something to do with I the sudden disappearance of Phyllis from the ball? Her smooth face betrayed none of the suspicions that were forming in her mind, however, as she sat chatting brightly on conventional topics, and she was still smiling when she rose a few minutes later with a little exclamation. \"Excuse me for a few minutes, Lieutenant Hampden,\" she said hastily. \"I have just remembered that my husband asked me to send of a telegram for him.\" The big drawing-room was divided oino two apartments by silken curtains looped up' by golden cords, the door being on the further side of curtains and hidden from view of Hector and Phyllis, who were seited in the front portion of the room. Hector bowedr as Mrs. Cramer hastened out, and sat silent until he heard her close the door of the room rather noisily. then he bent-forward quickly, his eyes on Phyllis' pale face. \"Miss Cramer, I have something important to say to you,\" he said quick' ly and quietly, his heart pounding wildly within him now that the op' portunity he had longed for had come. \"Last night, Captain Jenkins -\" Ho paused, suddenly at a loss how to explain. \"Yes?\" said Phyllis, with obviously forced calmness, for Hector could read fear in her eyes, and she was gripping the arms of her chair so tightly that her knuckles stood up white. \"Yes?\" she repeated, moistening her lips. \"I live at 99 Albany Chambers, and my fiat is just above that occupied by Captain Jenkins, Miss Cramer,\" proceeded Hector, somewhat hoarsely and Jerkily. \"Last night-you were there- u saw you-heard-\" \"You saw me!\" Phyllis sprang to her feet, her clenched hand pressed to her cheek in an attitude of terror, her eyes dilated, and her beautifulf face livid. \"You saw-then-\" Her voice died away to a faint moan, she suddenly swayed, flung out her hands, and would have fallen, had not Hector leaped to his feet and caught her. For a few moments she lay limp in his strong arms, and the physical contact thrilled him even as he gazed helplessly around the room, wondering what he should do. -\"Miss Cramer! Miss Cramer!\" he whispered hoarsely, and the sound of his voice seemed to revive the fainting girl. WVith a great effort she shook off the faintness that had overcome her, raised her head and stood erect, panting, and staring somewhat wildly. \"You-it was you!\" she gasped brokenly.  \"Yes, it was I,\" said-Hector gently, his supporting arm still around her slim waist \"Please don't break down, Miss Cramer. Mrs. Cramer may come back at any minute, and there is so much to be explained. Sit down here.\" He guided Phyllis to a settee, and seating himself by her side, waited quietly until she had to some extent regained her composure, then continued quickly:\"You \"You need not be alarmed. I have not told anyone that I saw you, and I am most anxious to help you if I can, but I want to know the truth. Why did you go to Jenkins' room last night, Miss Cramer, and why-why did you kill him?\" \"1!\" she ejaculated faintly. \"I didnot kill him! I thought that youthat you killed him!\" It was Hector's turn to gasp now, and for a moment a dreadful fear flashed into his mind as he stared in astonishment at Phyllis. \"I hardly think you mean that, Miss Cramer,\" he said quietly, after a pause, \"although I admit it would be quite possible to throw suspicion on me. Perhaps it will clear away any misapprehension if I tell you how much I know.\" Briefly but lucidly he related what he had seen and heard on the previous night and what he had told the police, and Phyllis listened in strained silence, her hand pressed to her heart. \"Now, Miss Cramer, perhaps you understand, and will believe that I am anxious to help you if I can,\" Hector concluded, \"but 1 must know everything. It is necessary for my own peace of mind as well as for your sake \"1 did not kill him,\" said Phyllis in a low, trembling voice. \"Surely you do not believe that I killed him? swear-\" \"Why did you go to his rooms at all?\" interposed Hector firmly. \"He threatened me, threatened that unless I-I went he would ruin my life,\" replied Phyllis, scarcely above a whisper. \"I-I was afraid, and went to appeal to him-to beg him to spare me. Oh, I realise now that I must hare been mad to do such a thing-to run such a terrible risk! I was mad at the time-mad with anxiety-oh, how can I explain?\" \"Do I understand that the man had some claim upon you, then?\" asked Hector, feeling as if an Icy hand had gripped his heart, for Phyllis' words seemed but to confirm his worst fears, to prove her guilt. \"Yes,\" Phyllis answered huskily, and tremulously. \"I cannot-I dare not explain fully, but-\" \"Pardon me, but you must explain fully,\" interposed Hector again, his face almost as white as that of the girl beside him. \"Don't you understand that you are in a great danger, and that if 1 am to help you I must know the truth. The police will undoubtedly question me again, and unless I know the true facts-I may unwittingly betray you. Besides, apart from that, it means much to me.\" \".11eans much to you? You mean that you are already suspected?\" \"No; 1 mean that-I love you,\" said Hector steadily. He took Phyllis' hand gently and held it fast as she recoiled in surprise, the warm color sweeping up from her throat to her white brow. \"Yes, 1-love you, and I want to help you,\" he repeated, his voice hoarse with suppressed emotion. \"Oh, 1 know that we have met only twice and that you-may think me mad, but I love you. This-this has brought us together, and you cannot look on me as a stranger. I-I don't ask you to give me any promise now -but-but I want you to understand how I feel and why I wish to serve you. Jenkins told me last night that you were his wife and-\" \",Ie lied!\" -said Phyllis quickly. \"He was a scoundrel-a villain, and 1 am glad-yes, glad!-he is dead.\" \"But you admitted that he had some claim upon you, and last night 1 know he was threatening you.\" \"Yes, I was afraid. He-oh, I can't explain fully, but once I-I was engaged to him.'I found out that he was a blackguard and was trying to deceive me, and I-I ran away. Last night .1 met him again for the first time since we parted, and he threat. ened that unless I consented to marry hiim he would tell Mr, and Mrs. Cramer that I was his wife and an adventuress. You see\"-her voice broke suddenly-\" had not told Mr. and Mlrs.' Cramer anything about him, and I have been happy here and put him out of my thoughts. You know that the Cramers are not really my parents, and that I am only their adopted daughter? I want to keep their love and their good oplnlon,-and if they cast me. ofi now I think it would break my. heart.\" \"But surely the Cramers would not - have believed such an outrageous stor, ?\" asked Hector, somewhat bewildered.  \"He had what he -called proofs, mostly false-and ol letters written before I found out wiat he was,\" explained Phyhlu, loe toing her eyeb. \"Last night, after you had intervened and before I could get away, he found me again and threatened me -terrified me. He swore that unless I came at once to his rooms he would kill you and make a dreadful scandal. I did not know what to do-I was almost beside myself with anxiety-and I-I went to his rooms to beg him to spare me-beg him to leave me alone. I know I should not have gone, and I know you must despise me-\"Her Her voice broke again, and she covered her face with her trembling hands.- Hector hesitated but for a moment, then masterfully encircled her with his arm, holding her tightly. \"No, - do not despise you,\" he said soothingly. \"I understand.\" Phyllis felt powerless to free herself. It comforted her and gave her courage to feel his strong arm protectingly around her, gave her new strength to know that he believed in her, although she surrendered almost against her will. \"Did you accompany him to his rooms?\" asked Hector, after a few moments of silence. \"No; he left the ball after threatening me, and it was some time before I could muster up courage to go,\" responded Phyllis in a low voice, dropping her hands from her face but not daring to raise her eyes. '\"There was no one could appeal to, so 1 went alone.\" \"Alone?\" queried Hector, recollecting that the policeman had said that he saw Jenkins enter with a lady. \"How did you get in? I mean, did the hall-porter admit you?\" \"No; the outer door was standing open, and I went in,\" Phyllis answered. \"There was nobody in the hall, but I saw by the name-plates that Captain Jenkins' chambers were on the second floor, and I went up at once.\" She covered her face again for a second, and shuddered. \"Was he alone?\" asked Hector. \"He was dead,\" whispered Phyllis. \"I rang the bell, but got no answer, and as the outer door was open I went in-and saw him. He was dead, shot through the head, and I screamed and ran out. I thought I heard a sound behind me, and looked back, but I saw no one. I was in a panic, andti once I reached the street I ran without noticing where 1 was going. When I came to myself I found I was in Piccadilly quite near to Dartmoor House, so I walked on a little way, then took a cab and drove home.\" Hector sat silent, at a loss to know what to think. lie fully believed that Plhyllis nad told the truth, yet there were so many thing that made him doubt in spite of himself. \"Did you kill him?\" asked Phyllis, 'uddenly breaking the silence. She nad gently disengaged herself from iiector's protecting arm and risen to ne' reet. \"What!\" ejaculated Hector, star. ing at her. \"No. Why do you ask such a question?\" \"lie had sworn to kill you, and 1 thought that perhaps-perhaps he had triled to carry out hissthreat and you had shot him,\" said Phyllis. \"It seemed strange to me that you-oh, I'm sorry, but perhaps you understand. And I am glad it was not you who killed him. What is to be done?\" '.'uthing, as far as you are concerned,\" Hector responded. \"We must just wait events, and you may rely upon me to protect you and to put the police off the scent.\" \"But you may be suspected your. self?\" Hector shrugged his broad shoulders and rose to his feet. \"I am innocent and suspicion cannot hurt me,\" he said quietly. \"I am glad to be able to serve you, and I shall hope to claim my reward some day. I must go now, but I will let you know if anything has happened when I come to-night. Mr. Cramer invited me to dine here to-night, you know, so we shall meet again later. Please tell Mrs. Cramer that I had an engagement and could opt stop. An revoir.\" Had he been on the alert he might possibly have noticed that, as he rose, the curtains that divided the room swayed slightly; might have heard a stealthy footstep, and heard the door of the drawing-room close gently. But neither he nor Phyllis heard any of these things, and had no means of knowing that when Mrs. Cramer had excused herself and left them together she had not left the roo., hut had merely retired behind the curtains and banged the door to make them believe that she had gone. Safely hidden by the curtains, she had heard every word! (To be Continued.)","wordCount":6297,"illustrated":false}

Nations Diddled by Nations.","fulltext":"Peace Traps of the Past. Nations Diddled by Nations. Probably the most perfect example Sof a peace trap succeeding was when the Sultan Murad V. of Turkey, then invading the Balkan States, was induced by specious promises to agree to a treaty of peace to last ten years. The treaty was sworn upon the Koran and the Bible, and it ought, therefore, one would have imagined, to have been regarded as binding by both sides. Yet no sooner had Murad withdrawn his garrisons than it :vas torn up by the other parties to it under the pretext that \"oaths are not to be kept with infidels.\" The result, however, in the long run, was not exactly in favor of the setters of the trap. For the Sultan, furious at the way he had been duped, Ire-invaded the Balkans at the head of an army so huge and well-equipped that it speedily beat down all opposition. Moreover, \"as a' visible appeal to the God of Truth, who punishes perjury among mankind,\" he caused a copy of the violated treaty, \"placed on a lance-head and raised aloft as a battle standard,\" to be borne in the 'van of his force. Our turn came in 1801, when Napoleon, by a clever blending \\of promises and threats, induced Addington, then Prime Minister of England, to agree to the Treaty of Amiens; the most fatuous ever entered into bi this or probably any other country. By it the wily Corsican got practically everything for which he had been fighting, while we, after spending £461,000,000 on the war-a prodigious sum in those days-obtained relatively nothing whatever. * As a matter of fact, indeed, we now know that Napoleon himself regarded the co-called \"Peace of Amiens\" as merely a prolonged armistice, to be utilised by him as a breathing spell, and a stepping-stone to further conquests. He expected it to last two years. Instead, war broke out again in less than eight months. Russia was rather discreditably duped in 1878. Turkey, defeated on the field of battle, offered as a condition of immediate peace to sign the Treaty of San Stefano, which gave Russia a large amount of ternwry. This she only did, however, after having received private assurances from the Great Powers that they would not agree to the treaty being ratified. Nor did they. No sooner had the Russian armies been withdrawn from Turkish territory, than a Congress of the Powers was assembled at Berlin to discuss the question, with the result that Russia was robbed of the greater portion of the fruits of her victory. Lord Beaconsfield, who attended the Congress as the British Plenipotentiary, was blamed in many quarters for this business. But as a matter of fact it was Germany and Austria who insisted on so harsh terms, the alternative being a declaration by them of immediate war against the Czar. In 1870, after the fall of Sedan, France was lulled to a false security for a while by Bismarck, who pretended that he was ready to grant favorable peace terms. The negotiations were conducted through Count Bernstorff, the Prussian Minister in Londcn, and Lord Lyons, our Ambassador in Paris. For two or three weeks the French armies remained inactive. Meanwhile Von .Moltke, behind the screen of far-flung armies, was bringing up number., sf heavy siege guns, destined for t. ; bombardment of Paris, and huge stores of munitions. Then, when all was in readiness, Bismarck threw off the mask. His \"favorable peace terms\" proved to be practically identical with those exceedingly harsh ones afterwards imposed, and which he knew perfectly well would not be accepted at that stage of the war. The answer of the French Government was exactly what he had foreseen and expected. \"We will not,\" it announced, \"cede an inch of our territories or a stone of our fortresses.\" Hostilities were thereupon renewed. But the delay proved fatal to France, for a few weeks later'the Germans had Paris encircled with a ring of steel and fire and held her there until famine compelled her to capitulate.","wordCount":701,"illustrated":false}
